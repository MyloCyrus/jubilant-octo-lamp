Preface 



This volume of translations of the Greek magical papyri has been a long time in the 
making. The project began in a planning colloquium at Claremont, California, 
May 31 to June 4, 1978. At this meeting, a team of scholars resolved to produce 
this translation volume as part of a research project on the Greek magical papyri, 
the project as a whole being designed as a contribution to the Corpus Hellenisticum 
Novi Testamenti. 

The translations turned out to be more difficult and time-consuming than had 
been expected. Since it seemed desirable to expand the Preisendanz collection to 
include as many newly discovered and newly published magical papyri as possible, 
the number of papyri increased from 81 to 131. In this respect, the translation vol- 
ume differs from the Preisendanz volumes. It differs also in that while Preisendanz 
reproduced only the Greek sections of bilingual Greek-Demotic papyri, this volume 
includes the full translations of all bilingual texts. 

All translations are based on the Greek, Demotic, and Coptic texts. PGM I— 
LXXXI follow the Preisendanz edition, while PGM LXXXII— CXXX and PDM 
Supplement follow their critical editions, which are indicated in the notes. Trans- 
lators were free to make changes in the texts when they thought it necessary; these 
changes are also indicated in the notes. Where earlier translations exist, they have 
been consulted, but all the translations included in this volume are new. 

Unlike the Preisendanz edition, this new volume does not have an apparatus criti- 
cus. Instead, it has notes explaining difficulties in the text and the translation, and 
notes alerting readers to important information. It has been necessary to limit these 
notes to a degree which many readers may find drastic, but the team decided not to 
attempt what could only be a lengthy commentary on the papyri. Instead, they 
agreed that other research tools should be developed to encourage and assist further 
research on the papyri. The following research tools are presently being prepared: 

1. An index of Greek words is being prepared by Professor Edward O’Neil. 

2. A subject index based on the English translation is being worked out by 
Ms. Marjorie Menaul. 

3. A collection of parallels between the magical papyri and early Christian litera- 
ture is being prepared by the research team. This part of the project is most directly 
related to the task of the Corpus Hellenisticum Novi Testamenti , namely, the collection 
of parallels from ancient literature to the New Testament and the other Christian 
literature up to approximately a. d. 150. 

4. A comprehensive bibliography, including editions and investigations of the 
magical papyri, is being assembled by Professor David Hellholm. 

The present volume would not have come about without the generous support 
of institutions and individuals. The National Endowment for the Humanities has 
funded the entire venture from the beginning by substantial grants from 1978 to 
1983. Without this financial assistance, the project would simply not exist; schol-

Preface 



arly team projects of this magnitude cannot live on enthusiasm alone. Apart from 
the purely financial aspect, the officers of the NEH have helped more than they may 
realize by their quiet encouragement and confidence expressed over a number of 
years. 

A great deal of assistance also came from the institutions where the project was 
initiated and where it is now based. These include the Institute for Antiquity and 
Christianity at Claremont, where the project was based during the years 1977 and 
1978, and the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion at the University of 
Chicago, where it has been from 1978 to the present. Thanks are especially due to 
the officers of these institutions. Professors James M. Robinson and James Brashler 
of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity; and Professors Joseph M. Kitagawa, 
formerly dean, and Franklin I. Gamwell, currently dean, of the Divinity School of 
the University of Chicago, as well as to Martin E. Marty, program coordinator for 
the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion of the University of Chicago. 

The present project could not have succeeded without the unfailing loyalty and 
generosity of the members of the team, both contributors and consultants. Among 
these should be named Professors Jan Bergman, Walter Burkert, Franco Maltomini, 
and P. J. Sijpesteijn. The research specialists of the project, Professor William C. 
Grese (1977-80), and Mr. Roy Kotansky and Ms. Marjorie Menaui (1980-83), 
not only helped to carry the burdens of administration and editorship, but made 
substantial contributions to the project as well. To all of them sincere thanks 
are due.

Table of Spells 



This list of spells presupposes the divisions in the texts and the identification of 
section titles made by the editor. In the Demotic spells, section titles are sometimes 
indicated by red lettering (but this is not done consistently). If no tides are given, 
this fart is stated (No tide) and a short description of content is added.

Explanation of References 
and Textual Signs 



PGM I. References cited thus refer to translations of the corresponding 

262—347 Greek text of Preisendanz’s Papyri Graeme Magicae, with each 

roman numeral (including those widi appended letters, e.g., 
PGM Va) corresponding to a separate papyrus manuscript. Ro- 
man numerals after PGM LXXXI refer to texts whose transla- 
tions are based on editions published since, and sometimes 
overlooked by, Preisendanz. The bibliographies of these edi- 
tions are mentioned in the introductory note (*) to each spell. 
Arabic numerals usually delineate the compass of individual 
spells within the papyrus manuscript. The use of the separate 
designations for each independent spell or charm represents a 
new feature designed to enable easy identification and ready 
reference to an individual spell. 

PDM xxi. 6-20 References listed thus refer to Demotic (bilingual) spells corre- 
sponding to the texts whose editions are listed in the introduc- 
tory note (*) to each spell. PDM stands for Papyri Demoticae 
Magicae , referring to this volume and not to be confused with 
DMP , an abbreviation for Griffith and Thompson, Demotic 
Magical Papyri , a work often referred to in the notes. Lower- 
case roman numerals are used simply to avoid confusion with 
spells labeled PGM. Arabic numerals are used as above. 

[PGM XII. PGM references bracketed thus come immediately after refer- 

445-48] ences for bilingual Greek sections with die given spell. The ref- 

erences correspond to the appropriate Greek portions in Prei- 
sendanz, whose edition contained only the Greek sections of 
the Greek/Demotic spells. Since this translation volume con- 
tains all the Demotic spells, Preisendanz’s numbering system is 
retained, but it is subsumed under the new Demotic collation. 

A,b,c Texts set in roman type represent spells and portions of spells 

whose original language was Greek. 

A,b,c Texts set with leader dots beneath represent spells and portions 

of spells whose original language was Demotic (Egyptian). 

A,b,c Texts with a thin underscore represent spells and portions of 

spells whose original language was Old Coptic. Coptic is found 
both in the Greek texts of Preisendanz’s edition and as glosses 
in portions of the Demotic/Greek bilingual spells; however, the 
purely Coptic magical spells form a separate corpus not dealt 
with in this volume.

References and Textual Signs 

An asterisk introduces an independent spell or a spell that con- 
tains most of the constituent parts necessary to effect the whole 
charm, though organic connections with adjacent spells can be 
recognized (e.g., spells entitled “ Another . . . or the like). 
The asterisk directs the reader to the contributor, whose name 
is given at the end of the spell. Some introductory comments 
may be found here as well. Bibliographical data, if appropriate, 
may also be listed. 

This abbreviation stands for “translator” or “transcriber” (if 
the text contains no recognizable words that can be translated). 

Phrases set in roman boldface type refer to general titles of 
charms which usually stand at the beginning of the spell and 
which are often followed by one or more subtitles. Many spells 
do not possess a title, either because of a scribal omission or 
because it has been lost in a lacuna in the text. 

Phrases set in italic boldface type refer to various subtitles and a 
number of types of rubrics (subsumed under the main tide) 
that function in a titular sense to introduce a component fea- 
ture of a spell. These may introduce ingredients, additional in- 
structions, invocations, figures, magical names and characters, 
and so on, which are mentioned in the instructions in the text. 
In a long, multifunctional spell (cf. PGM IV. 2145-2240 and 
PGM XIII. 1—343), general tides are subordinate to the larger 
dtie, which describes an often elaborate ritual. In description, 
these general tides are identical to the main tides of most spells 
but are set as subtitles since they usually depend on a prior set 
of conditions to guarantee their efficacy. 

Small capital letters indicate magical names (voces magime) 
which are usually untranslatable and often meaningless to the 
reader. In some instances, small capital letters preserve recog- 
nizable Greek, Egyptian, or Semitic words that merit special at- 
tention. Portions of texts whose fragmentary nature precludes 
the possibility of proper translation, but which may in fact have 
been readable in the original, are also set in small capitals. 

A diagonal slash indicates every fifth line of translated text, cor- 
responding to the number given in the left-hand margin. Usu- 
ally these are numbered consecutively until a new papyrus num- 
ber is introduced. 

A bracketed number alongside the regular number refers to the 
line number of the original edition (in a Greek/Demotic text). 
Occasionally at the beginning the column number and line are 
also cited (e.g., [Col. Ill, 5]. 

A number in parentheses refers to the original line of Preisen- 
danz in a Greek/Demotic spell. The number corresponds to the 
PGM reference given within the bracketed number at the head 
of the spell. 



References and Textual Signs xxxiii 

An ellipsis in the body of the text refers to a lost portion re- 
gardless of the size of the lacuna. Some punctuation (e:g., a 
comma or a period) may also be added at the end of the ellipsis. 

[spell] Brackets enclosing words indicate that the words are not pre- 

served in the original text. These include (1) suggested res- 
torations of lacunae; (2) editorial expansions of the text to 
elucidate the sense of the original language; and (3) phrases 
traditionally ser off by pointed brackets { ), namely, modern 
corrections to scribal omissions or errors. Scholars interested 
in determining which use the bracketed text refers to are rec- 
ommended to consult the texts of the original editions. As a 
general rule, bracketed cexrs will not divide a word, but will 
surround the whole word if its reading is fairly uncertain. 

(add the usual) Parentheses enclosing words simply indicate material in the 
. original texts best understood as parenthetical comments of the 
ancient authors and redactors. 

“Come to Quotation marks enclosing words indicate material diat is 

me . . spoken (or intended to be spoken) or written (or intended to 

be written). Material not enclosed in quotation marks usually 
refers to parts of a formulary' that contain, instructions and di- 
rections apart from the material to be written or spoken. Such 
instructions are peculiar to the papyri that have preserved mag- 
ical formularies, whereas the actual amulets and phylacteries 
found on papyrus usually contain simple invocations that have 
been transcribed as a result of following the instructions in 
such magical handbooks. 

Incantations originally written in Greek meter are set as verse, 
that is, they are indented en bloc , with the first letter of each line 
capitalized. In cases where the meter falters within such a hynv 
nic portion, the original margin is restored to indicate prose. 

NN In the magical formularies, this abbreviation stands for a name 

or names to be inserted by the reader, the names of the persons 
against or for whom the magic: is to be carried out. In rite case 
of “(the) NN matter,” the reader understands that specific re- 
quests are to be named at diis point. 

[R.K.R. | At the end of each footnote, the bracketed initials refer to the 

contributing scholar responsible for the material immediately 
preceding. Notes that carry no initials represent the joint ef- 
forts of the contributors and scholars.

Introduction to the 
Greek Magical Papyri 

Hans Dieter Betz 



“The Greek magical papyri 1 ” is a name given by scholars to a body of papyri from 
Greco-Roman Egypt containing a variety of magical spells and formulae, hymns 
and rituals. The extant texts are mainly from the second century b.c. to the fifth 
century a.d. To be sure, this body of material represents only a small number of all 
the magical spells that once existed. 1 Beyond these papyri we possess many odier 
kinds of material: artifacts, symbols and inscriptions on gemstones, on ostraka and 
clay bowls, and on tablets of gold, silver, lead, tin and so forth. 2

The history of the discovery of the Greek magical papyri is a fascinating subject. 3 
We know from literary sources that a large number of magical books in which spells 
were collected existed in antiquity. Most of them, however, have disappeared as the 
result of systematic suppression and destruction. The episode about the burning of 
the magical books in Ephesus in the Acts of tire Aposdcs (Acts 19 : 10) is well 
known and typical of many such instances. According to Suetonius, 4 Augustus or- 
dered 2,000 magical scrolls to be burned in the year 13 b.c. Indeed, the first cen- 
turies of the Christian era saw many burnings of books, often of magical books, 
and not a few burnings that included the magicians themselves. 

As a result of these acts of suppression, the magicians and their literature went 
underground. The papyri diemselves testify to this by the constantly recurring ad- 
monition to keep the books secret. 5 Yet the systematic destruction of the magical 
literature over a long period of time resulted in the disappearance of most of the 
original texts by the end of antiquity. To us in the twentieth century, terms such as 
“underground literature” and “suppressed literature” are well known as descriptions 
of contemporary phenomena. We also know that such literature is extremely impor- 
tant for the understanding of what people arc really thinking and doing in a par- 
ticular time, geographical area, or cultural context. Magical beliefs and practices 
can hardly be overestimated in their importance for the daily life of the people. The 
religious beliefs and practices of most people were identical with some form of 
magic, and the neat distinctions we make today between approved and disapproved 
forms of religion— calling the former “religion” and “church” and the latter “magic” 
and “cult” — did not exist in antiquity except among a few intellectuals. 6 

Thus the suppression of this magical literature has deprived us of one of our most 
important sources of ancient religious life. Modem views of Greek and Roman reli- 
gions have long suffered from certain deformities because they were unconsciously 
shaped by the only remaining sources: the literature of the cultural elite, and the 
archeological remains of the official cults of the states and cities. 

But not everything was lost. 7 At the end of antiquity, some philosophers and 
theologians, astrologers and alchemists collected magical books and spells that were 
still available. Literary writers included some of the material in their works, if only

to make fun of it. It is known that philosophers of the Neopvthagorean and Neo- 
platonic schools, as well as Gnostic and Hermetic groups, used magical books and 
hence must have possessed copies. But most of their material vanished and what we 
have left are their quotations. 

The Greek magical papyri are, however, original documents and primary sources. 
Their discovery is as important for Greco-Roman religions as is the discovery of the 
Qumran texts for Judaism or the Nag Hammadi library for Gnosticism. 8 

Like these manuscript discoveries, the discovery of the Greek magical papyri was 
and often still is the outcome of sheer luck and almost incredible coincidences. In 
the case of the major portion of the collection, the so-called Anastasi collection, the 
discovery and rescue is owed to the efforts (and, if one may use the term, coopera- 
tion) of two individuals separated by more than a thousand years: the modem col- 
lector d’Anastasi and the original collector at Thebes. 

In the nineteenth century, there was among the “diplomatic” representatives at 
the court in Alexandria a man who called himself Jean d’Anastasi (1780?- 1857). 
Believed to be Armenian by birth, he ingratiated himself enough with the pasha to 
become the consular representative of Sweden. 9 It was a time when diplomats and 
military men often were passionate collectors of antiquities, and M. d’Anastasi hap- 
pened to be at the right place at the right time. He succeeded in bringing together 
large collections of papyri from Egypt, among them sizable magical books, some of 
which he said he had obtained in Thebes. 10 These collections he shipped to Europe, 
where they were auctioned off' and bought by various libraries: the British Museum 
in London, the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Louvre in Paris, the Staatlichc Mu- 
seen in Berlin, and die Rijksmuseum in Leiden. Another papyrus was acquired 
by Jean Francois Mimaut (1774-1837), also a diplomat, whose acquisition ended 
up in the Bibliotheque Nationale ( PGM III)." Unfortunately, we know almost 
nothing about the circumstances of the actual findings. But it is highly likely that 
many of the papyri from the Anastasi collection came from the same place, perhaps 
a tomb or a temple library. 12 If this assumption is correct, about half a dozen of the 
best-preserved and largest extant papyri may have come from the collection of one 
man in Thebes. He is of course unknown to us, but we may suppose that he col- 
lected the magical material for his own use. Perhaps he was more than a magician. 
We may attribute his almost systematic collections of maqica to a man who was also 
a scholar, 13 probably philosophically inclined, as well as a bibliophile and archivist 
concerned about the preservation of this material. 14 

Although the person who collected the Anastasi papyri remains unknown, com- 
parable figures are known from later Egyptian literature. In the Demotic Papyrus 
no. 30646 in the Cairo Museum, there appears Prince Khamwas, the fourth son of 
King Ramses II and high priest of Ptah in Memphis. This legendary figure belongs 
to the Stories of the High Priests of 'Memphis , published by Francis Llewelyn Griffith, 15 
stories that in many ways can serve as illustrative companions to the Greek magical 
papyri. Miriam Lichtheim has given this summary portrait in the third volume of 
her Ancient Egyptian Literature: 

Prince Khamwas, son of King Ramses II and high priest of Ptah at 
Memphis, was a very learned scribe and magician who spent his time in 
the study of ancient monuments and books. One day he was told of the 
existence of a book of magic written by the god Thoth himself and kept 
in the tomb of a prince named Naneferkaptah (Na-nefer-ka-ptah), who 
lived in the distant past and was buried somewhere in the vast nec- 
ropolis of Memphis. After a long search, Prince Khamwas, accom-

panied by his foster brother Inaros, found the tomb of Naneferkaptah 
and entered it. He saw the magic book, which radiated a strong light, 
and tried to seize it. But the spirits of Naneferkaptah and of his wife 
Ahwcre rose up to defend their cherished possession. . . , 16 

The collection of the Anastasi papyri, if it was brought together by one per- 
son, mav have been buried with him, either in his tomb or in the rubble of col- 
lapsed buildings. At any rate, when d’ Anastasi came to Thebes and the papyri were 
offered to him, he sensed their value and acquired them, thus saving them from 
destruction. 

It took almost another century, however, before scholars learned to appreciate 
the value of the papvri and started investigating them. It is noteworthy that the 
auction catalog of d’Anastasi’s collection calls the material simply “fromage mys- 
tique.” 17 Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the papyri were stored in the 
museums simply as curiosities. 

Scholarly investigations began when the great Dutch scholar Caspar Jacob Chris- 
tiaan Reuvens (1793—1835) described some of the content of the Leiden papyrus 
J 395 ( PGM XIII) in his Lettres a M. Letronne published in 1830. 18 This work was 
reviewed almost immediately by the German historian of religion Karl Otfried 
Muller (1797-1840), who also translated Reuvens’s excerpts into German. 19 But 
Reuvens died before his edition of the Leiden papyri could appear. It was forty 
years before another Dutch scholar, the Egyptologist Conrad Leemans (1809—93), 
published the edition ( PGM XII, XIII) 20 together with a Latin translation (1885). 21 

The first publication, however, is due to the efforts of the British scholar Charles 
Wycliffe Goodwin (1817-78), who published one of the papyri ( PGM V) to- 
gether with an English translation and commentary for the Cambridge Antiquarian 
Society in 1853. 22 Then the German philologist Gustav Parthey (1798-1872) 
edited the two papyri from Berlin in 1865 ( PGM I, II). 23 A very? important new 
phase began when the Viennese papyrologist Carl Wessely (1860— 1931) published 
in 1888 a transcription of the great magical papyrus of Paris ( PGM IV), the Lon- 
don papyrus ( PGM V), and the Mimaut papyrus ( PGM III), 24 followed in 1889 by 
corrections. 25 In 1893 both Wessely 26 and Frederick George Kenyon (1863— 
1952) 27 independendy edited and published the magical papyri of London ( PGM 
VII-X). The last major papyrus was published in 1925 by the Norwegian scholar 
Samson Eitrem (1872— 1966), 28 who had acquired in Egypt a valuable magical 
scroll with many drawings ( PGM XXXVI). 

With these important publications, the major pieces of the Greek magical papyri 
known to this period had become available. It seems to have been a suggestion first 
made by die great scholar of Greek religion, Albrecht Dieterich (1866-1908), that 
all the available papyri should be published in a handy study edition. But this idea 
developed only gradually after Dieterich began teaching a seminar on the subject of 
the magical papyri at the LTniversity of Heidelberg in 1905. 29 

Today it is astonishing to learn that teaching such a seminar at that time was quite 
a daring enterprise. Magic was so utterly despised by historians and philologists 
that the announcement of the seminar did not mention the word ‘"magic” but was 
simply phrased as “Selected Pieces from the Greek Papyri.” 30 

How far the dislike of the magical papyri could go is illustrated by a remark made 
by Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff: “I once heard a well-known scholar com- 
plain that these papyri were found because they deprived antiquity of the noble 
splendor of classicism.” 31 

Dieterich, 32 however, was at the edge of a wave of interest generated by the new

discipline of history of religions. His seminar therefore had a surprising attraction 
for students, some of whom wrote their dissertations on related subjects and be- 
came contributors to the study edition. The plan for such a study edition was seri- 
ously threatened by Dietcrich’s sudden death on 6 May 1908, but the work was 
taken over by Dieterich’s students, foremost of whom was Richard Wunsch, chief 
editor. Adam Abt, Ludwig Fahz, Adolf Erman, Georg Moller, and other contribu- 
tors 33 stepped in to carry on the work. 

When the body of the material of PGM I-IV was almost ready. World War I 
broke out and interrupted the work. Wunsch, Abt, and Moller were killed in the 
war. Despite these terrible losses and the desperate economic situation following 
the war, the publisher, B. G. Teubner of Leipzig, did not give up the project, but 
decided to start over. The edition was entrusted to Karl Preisendanz (1883-1968), 
another of Dietenclis former students. 34 Scholars at that time faced difficulties 
scarcely conceivable to us today, yet they persisted. In addition, a remarkable degree 
of international cooperation existed among die scholars. 35 Sam Eitrem from Oslo 
and Adolf Jacoby from Luxemburg joined the team, and British, French, and Dutch 
scholars gave their support to the effort. The Notgemeinschaft der Deutschcn 
Wissenschaft as well as other governmental agencies gave financial support, so that 
despite all die problems the first volume of the first edition of the Papyri Gmecae 
Magicae could appear in 1928, with a second volume following in 1931. 36 

While all this was happening, new magical papyri were being discovered and 
published. A third volume, which was also supposed to contain extensive indexes, 
therefore became necessary. But this volume never appeared, for World War II 
broke out. 

Despite the war, the work had progressed to the actual production of galley 
proofs, with the preface dated “Pentecost, 1941,” 37 when on 4 December 1943 the 
publishing house of Teubner in Leipzig was bombed and everything was de- 
stroyed. 38 Fortunately, however, the galley proofs survived the war and are at pres- 
ent being used by a number of scholars in the form of xerox copies. When Karl 
Preisendanz, the editor of the first edition and tireless promoter of the study of the 
Greek magical papyri before and after World War II, died on 26 April 1968, the 
publishing house of Teubner, which had in part been relocated in Stuttgart, West 
Gennany, decided to bring out a new edition. This new edition was prepared by 
Albert Henrichs, a papyrologist from Cologne, who has been on the faculty of 
Harvard University since 1973. 39 It appeared in two volumes in 1973— 74. 40 The 
first volume is mostly a reprint of the first edition, though many corrections have 
been made. The second volume, however, is considerably different from the first 
edition. A number of papyri were reedited completely, and the papyri originally 
planned to appear in vol. Ill were added so that vol. II of the 1974 edition contains 
all pieces up to PGM LXXXI. The idea of a third volume containing the indexes was 
postponed because all indexes would have to be redone in view of the changes and 
additions in the material. 



II 

What is the significance of the Greek magical papyri? Scholars since Albrecht Dic- 
terich have consistently pointed out the importance of the Greek magical papyri to 
the study of ancient religions; thus we can limit ourselves here to a summary of the 
issues. 41 

Historians of religion are intrigued by the Greek magical papyri for a number of 
reasons. If, as Dieterich rightly says, 42 the papyri are a depository of a great reli-

Introduction to the Greek Magical Papyri 

gious literature over many centuries, the recovery of the sources becomes a task of 
primary interest. In fact, throughout these sources we find citations of hymns, ritu- 
als, formulae from liturgies otherwise lost, and little bits of mythology called histo- 
riolcie. These older materials are now embedded in a secondary context, but by care- 
ful application of the methods of literary criticism they are often recoverable . 48 

Taken as a whole, the material presents a plethora of interesting problems for 
modern scholarship. One must realize first that the material assembled under the 
name Greek magical papyri represents a collection of texts of diverse origin and 
nature. This collection includes individual spells and remedies, as well as collections 
made by ancient magicians, from the early Hellenistic period to late antiquity. 
Since the material comes from Greco- Roman Egypt, it reflects an amazingly broad 
religious and cultural pluralism. Not surprising is the strong influence of Egyptian 
religion throughout the Greek magical papyri, although here the texts nevertheless 
show a great variety. Expressed in Greek, Demotic, or Coptic, some texts represent 
simply Egyptian religion. In others, the Egyptian element has been transformed by 
Hellenistic religious concepts. Most of the texts arc mixtures of several religions — 
Egyptian, Greek, Jewish, to name the most important. 

The picture presented by the Greek magical papyri has been changed substan- 
tially by the inclusion of the translation of the Demotic magical papyri. In Preisen- 
danz’s edition, the Demotic material was deleted, even when it occurred in the same 
papyrus as Greek sections apparently written by the same scribe. The inclusion of 
the Demotic material in the present translation raises new and intriguing questions 
regarding the relationship between the Greek texts and the antecedent Egyptian 
sources. Further studies must clarify the process of transmission and transforma- 
tion of these texts. Such studies will gain new insights into the complex phenomena 
of the hellenization of religious traditions. (See also die Introduction to the De- 
motic texts below.) 

Another interesting problem is posed by the fact that this material from Greco- 
Roman Egypt contains many sections that are Greek in origin and nature . 44 How 
did this older Greek religious literature find its way into Egypt? We do not, and 
probably never shall, know. In this older material, the Greek gods are alive and well. 
But Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, and others arc portrayed not as 
Hellenic and aristocratic, as in literature, but as capricious, demonic, and even dan- 
gerous, as in Greek folklore . 45 The gods and their activities resemble those in the 
popular myths and local cults, as reported by mythographers or by Pausanias. 
Therefore, strange as it may sound, if we wish to study Greek folk religion, die 
magical papyri found in Egypt are to be regarded as one of the primary sources. 4 * 

Questions similar to those appropriate to the study of Greek religion must be 
raised in view of the material (divine names as well as entire passages) that comes 
from some form of Judaism. Jewish magic was famous in antiquity , 4 and more 
sources have come to light in recent years; but the origin and nature of the sections 
representing Jewish magic in the Greek magical papyri is far from clear. Did this 
material actually originate with Jewish magicians? How did it get into the hands of 
the magicians who wrote the Greek magical papyri? What kind of transformation 
took place in the material itself? If the texts in question come from Judaism, what 
type of Judaism do they represent? 

The historian of religion will be especially interested in the kind of syncretism 
represented in the Greek magical papyri . 48 This syncretism is more than a mixture of 
diverse elements from Egyptian, Greek, Babylonian, and Jewish religion, with a few 
sprinkles of Christianity . 49 Despite the diversity of texts, there is in the whole cor- 




xlvi 



Introduction to the Greek Magical Papyri 

pus a tendency toward assimilation and uniformity. Such assimilation and unifor- 
mity, however, includes primarily the religious traditions already mentioned: the 
Romans, although in control of Egypt by the time most of the papyri were written, 
left only a few traces in the material. Thus the papyri represent a Greco-Egyptian, 
rather than the more general Greco- Roman, syncretism. 

In this syncretism, the indigenous ancient Egyptian religion has in part survived, 
in part been profoundly hellenized . 50 In its Hellenistic transformation, the Egyp- 
tian religion of the pre-Hellenistic era appears to have been reduced and simplified, 
no doubt to facilitate its assimilation into Hellenistic religion as the predominant 
cultural reference. It is quite clear that the magicians who wrote and used the Greek 
papyri were Hellenistic in outlook. 

Hellenization, however, also includes the egvptianizing of Greek religious tradi- 
tions. The Greek magical papyri contain many instances of such egvptianizing 
transformations, which take very different forms in different texts or layers of tradi- 
tion. Again, working out the more exact nature of this religious and cultural inter- 
action remains the task of future research. 

The papyri also provide many insights into the phenomenon of the magician as a 
religious functionary, in both the Egyptian and die Hellenistic setting. One must 
be cautious, however, in making generalizing statements in regard to die figure of 
the magician in the Greek magical papyri . 51 Some of the magicians writing and 
using the spells may have been associated with temples of Egyptian and Greek dei- 
ties. According to Egyptian practice, the magician was a resident member of the 
temple priesthood. Genuine understanding of the older Egyptian and Greek lan- 
guages and traditions can be assumed in some of the material, but by no means in 
all instances. 

There are texts reflecting perhaps a different type of magician, a type we know 
from the Greek religious milieu . 52 This type of wandering craftsman seems keen to 
adopt and adapt every religious tradition that appeared useful to him, while the 
knowledge and understanding of what he adopted was characterized by a certain 
superficiality. This type of magician no longer understood the old languages, al- 
though he used remnants of them in transcription. He recited and used what must 
at one time have been metrically composed hymns; but he no longer recognized the 
meter, and he spoiled it when he inserted his own material. In the hands of magi- 
cians of this type, the gods from the various cults gradually merged, and as their 
natures became blurred, they often changed into completely different deities. For 
these magicians, there was no longer any cultural difference between the Egyptian 
and the Greek gods, or between them and the Jewish god and the Jewish angels; 
and even Jesus was occasionally assimilated into this truly ‘'ecumenical” religious 
syncretism of foe Hellenistic world culture. 

We should make it clear, however, that this syncretism is more than a hodge- 
podge of heterogeneous items. In effect, it is a new religion altogether, displaying 
unified religious attitudes and beliefs. As an example, one may mention the enor- 
mously important role of the gods and goddesses of the underworld. The role of 
these underworld deities was not new to Egyptian religion or, to some extent, to 
ancient Greek religion; but it is characteristic of foe Hellenistic syncretism of the 
Greek magical papyri that the netherworld and its deities had become one of its 
most important concerns. The goddess Hekate, identical with Persephone, Selene, 
Artemis, and the old Babylonian goddess Ereschigal, is one of the deities most 
often invoked in the papyri. Through the egvptianizing influence of Osiris, Isis, 
and their company, other gods like Hermes, Aphrodite, and even the Jewish god

Introduction ro the Greek Magical Papyri 

entire religions, the scientific and technological revolutions, and the triumphs of 
modem medicine. Despite all these changes, there has always been an unbroken 
tradition of magic. Why is magic so irrepressible and ineradicable, if it is also true 
that its claims and promises never come truer Or do they? Do people never check up 
on the efficiency of magicians? 

The answer appears to be that, in general, people are not interested in whether or 
not magicians’ promises come true. People want to believe, so they simply ignore 
their suspicions that magic mav all be deception and fraud. The enormous role de- 
ception plays in human life and society is well known to us . 56 In many crucial areas 
and in many critical situations of life, deception is the only method that really 
works. As the Roman aphorism sums it up, “Mundus vult decipi, ergo dccipiatur” 
(“The world wishes to be deceived, and so it may be deceived”). To an immeasur- 
able extent, people’s lives earn' on by what they decide they want to believe rather 
than by what they should believe or even know, by what appears to be real rather 
than by what is really real, by props and by fads, and by gobbledvgook of this kind 
today and that kind tomorrow'. 

Magicians are those who have long ago explored these dimensions of the human 
mind. Rather than decrying the facts, they have exploited them. Magicians have 
known all along that people’s religious need and expectations provide the greatest 
opportunity for the most effective of all deceptions. But instead of turning against 
religion, as the skeptics among the Greek and Roman philosophers did, the magi- 
cians made use of it. After all, magic is nothing but the art of making people believe 
that something is being done about those things in life about which we all know 
tli at we ourselves can do nothing. 

Magic is the art that makes people who practice it fed better rather than worse, 
that provides the illusion of security to the insecure, the feeling of help to the help- 
less, and the comfort of hope to the hopeless. 

Of course, it is all deception. But w'ho can endure naked reality, especially when 
there is a way to avoid it? This is why magic has worked and continues to work, no 
matter what the evidence may be. Those whose lives depend on deception and de- 
lusion and those who provide them have formed a truly indissoluble symbiosis. 
Magic makes an unmanageable life manageable for those who believe in it, and a 
profession profitable for those who practice die art.

6. A definition of the notion of magic cannot be attempted here. In order to provide an 
adequate definition, the complexities of the notion, its relations with “religion” and “sci- 
ence,” and the rather frustrating history and literature of the problem would have to be dis- 
cussed first. For a good introduction to the question, sec A. A. Barb, “The Survival of Magic 
Arts,” in The Conflict between Paganism and Christianity in the Fourth Century , ed. A. Mo- 
migliano (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963) 100-125; G. Widengren, Religionsphdmmenologie

Introduction to the Greek Magical Papyri 

12. Cf. the report of another collector who speaks of his “residence of eighteen years at 
Thebes, entirely devoted to its objects of antiquity” (p. IX). This man, a Greek named 
Giovanni d’Athanasi, from the island of Lemnos, the son of a Cairo merchant, wrote his 
storv at the suggestion of English travelers: Giovanni d’Athanasi, A Brief Account of the Re- 
searches and Discoveries in Upper Egypt , made under the direction of Henry Salt, Esq., to which is 
added a detailed catalogue of Mr. Salt’s collection of Egyptian Antiquities; illustrated with twelve 
engravings of some of the most interesting objects, and an enumeration of those articles purchased for 
the British Museum (London: John Hearnc, 1836). As d’Athanasi reports, the papyri arc 
found mostly in or near tombs; so he says about the Demotic papyri: “they are very rare, and 
are found not in die mummies, but in the terra-cotta urns which are found closed up and 
buried in the earth around the tombs” (p. 79). See also the Catalogue of the Very .Magnificent 
and Extraordinary Collection of Egyptian Antiquities, the Property of Giovanni d’Athanasi, which 
will be sold by auction by Mr. Leigh Sotheby, at his house, 3, Wellington Street, Strand, on Monday, 
March 13th, 1837, and the Six following Days ( Sunday excepted), at One o’Clock precisely (Lon- 
don: J. Davy, 1837) 23-24: “Manuscript Rolls of Papyrus, found in the tombs at Thebes.” 
On the whole subject, see Wolfgang Speyer, Bucherfunde in der Glaubenswerbung derAntike 
(Gottingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1970), esp. 44ff.: books placed as gifts in tombs. 

13. PGMV.z is a loose page stuck into a work on chemistry, the Papyrus graecus Holmiensis 
in Stockholm. This indicates that the owner and collector of die magical material also pos- 
sessed works on chemistry. See also B. Olsson, “Zwei Papyrusstellen besprochen,” Aegyptus 
1.2 (1932) : 355-56; Preisendanz, Papyrusfunde und Papyrusforschung 91-92.

tian (!) tomb in Thebes. It should be noted that die story dealing with the search for the 
secret book has a parallel in Pseudo-Democritus, who may be identical with Bolos of Men- 
des. According to this text, Democritus went to Memphis where he was received by Ostanes 
and his students in the temple of Ptah, but Ostanes died before he initiated Democritus into 
his mysteries and handed his secret books over to him. Democritus also brought up the 
shadow of Ostanes from Hades and asked him about the books. Ostanes replied that they 
were in the temple, where they were finally discovered. Both names occur also in PGM (De- 
mocritus: VII.167, 795; XII. 351; Ostanes: IV.2006; XII. 122). The text is given in J. Bidez 
and F. Cumont, Les mages hellenises II (Paris: Societe d’edition “Les belles lettres 1938) 
317-18; see J. H. Waszink, “Bolos,” RAC 2 (1954) : 502— 8; Speyer, Bucherfunde 26—27,

gehend, mit Huife mctaphysischer Speculationen und verworrener Naturkenntnisse, sich zu

Es nimmt mich immer wieder wunder, dass der unermeftliche Gewinn, der aus 
den Zauberpapyri nach so vielen Seiten hin zu erlangen ist, nur so wenige Ar- 
beiter lockt. Wie mancher, der rcligionsgeschichtliche Arbeit tun will, rate bes- 
ser hier sich zu bemuhen als um Probleme herumzuredcn, zu deren Losung 
er doch nichts beitragen kann. Nach dem Schema der ‘Papyrologie’ gehoren 
sie weder zu den Urkunden noch zu den literarischen Papyri; denn dafi sich 
hier die groBe religiose Literatur von Jahrhnnderten niedergeschlagen hat, ist 
nur sehr wenigen deutlich. Die Unbckanntschaft mit den magischen Papyri 
macht sich zum Schadcn so mancher religionshistorischer Arbeiten, auch der 
letzten Jahre, bemerklich, und da die wichtigste Publikation von Wessely in den 
Denkschriften der Wiener Akademie, philos.-hist. Klasse XXXYI Band 1888, 
allerdings ohne cigene rccensio und emendatio kaum benutzbar ist, habe ich cs 
mit einem meincr Schuler zusammen unternommen, zuniichst wenigstens das 
kapitalste Stuck dieser Literatur, das grosse Pariser Zauberbuch, in einer neuen 
Ausgabe vorzulegen.

Ich habe einmai gehort, wie cin bedeutender Gelchrter bekiagte, dass diese Pa- 
pyri gefunden waren, weil sie dem Altcrtum den vomehmen Schimmer der 
Klassizitat nchmen. Dass sie das thun, ist unbestreitbar, aber ich ffeue mich des- 
sen. Denn ich will meine Hellenen nicht bewundern, sondem verstehen, damit 
ich sic gerecht beurteilen kann. Und selbst Mahadoh, der Herr der Erden, — soli 
er strafen, soli er schonen, muss er den Mcnschen menschlich sehn. 

32. It should be noted, however, that Dietcrich’s doctoral dissertation was already de- 
voted to the subject, a work that posed most of the pertinent problems. The dissertation 
was published in an expanded form under die tide “Papyrus magica musei Lugduncnsis

its prolegomena were reprinted in his Kleine Schriften (Leipzig: Teubner, 1911) 1-47.

53. Some of these handbooks are among the PGM. How they were made can still be seen 
from the partly unfinished, late Byzantine (16th c.) copy in the Gennadios Library in Athens 
(Codex Gcnnadianus 45), the text of which was published by A. Delatte, “Un nouveau tem- 
oin de la iitterature solomonique, le codex Gcnnadianus AS d’Athenes,” Bulletin de l Academic 
royale de Belgique, Classe des lettres , 5 t serie, tome 45 (1959) : 280-321. 

54. As I have tried to show, even the human self was regarded as a daimon which could be 
handled by the magician in die same way as all the other energies of the universe. See H. D. 
Betz, “The Delphic Maxim 'Know Yourself’ in the Greek Magical Papyri,” HR 21 (1981) : 
156-71. 

55. A beautiful testimony of this self-understanding is cited by D. Wildung, Egyptian 
Saints: Deification in Pharaonic Egypt (New York: New York University Press, 1977) 84—85, 
where the great magician Amcnhotep says about himself: 

I am really magnificent among any people, one with a heaving heart when he is 
looking for a plan in some unknown problem, like one whose heart knows it 
already; who finds a sentence even if it was found destroyed; master of wisdom, 
friend of the ruler, who does useful things for the Horns, who makes his monu- 
ments splendid in order to cause everybody to remember him forever at the au- 
gust place. Who guides the ignorant through the events since the primeval 
times, who shows dieir place to everybody who forgot about it; useful in his 
ideas, when he is looking for monuments to make immortal the name of his 
lord; who relates the proverb and acts with his fingers; leader of mankind, of 
engaging manners as a pleasant one. Who venerates the name of the king and 
his power, who praises his Majesty at any time of the day, who is on his guard in 
all his decisions. . . .” 

56. A good illustration of the phenomenon is the social and psychological syndrome 
called “cognitive dissonance.” The syndrome can be observed among persons of strong con- 
viction who, when faced with evidence to die contrary of dieir convictions (“disconfirma- 
rioiT), become more intense and close themselves off from their social context, radier than 
develop doubts about these convictions. Sec die study by Leon Fcstinger, Henry W. Riecken, 
and Stanley Schachter, When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of' a Modern 
Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World (New York: Harper and Row, 1964). The 
authors of this study themselves may have become another instance of the syndrome: appar- 
endy they entered into the project armed with strong convictions about the origins of reli- 
gion and, without ever becoming suspicious, found nothing but confirmation. 




Introduction to the 
Demotic Magical Papyri 

Janet H. Johnson 



As important as the Greek magical papyri are to the understanding of Greco- 
Roman religion, as noted by Betz in his Introduction to the Greek, magical texts, 
their full significance can be perceived only when it is realized that these texts writ- 
ten in Greek are part of a larger corpus that also includes texts written in that stage 
of the Egyptian language known as “Demotic,” and that the corpus as a whole de- 
rives in very large measure from earlier Egyptian religious and magical beliefs and 
practices. The interrelationship between the Greek and Egyptian aspects of these 
magical texts is emphasized by the fact that not only did the major find of such 
texts, the collection of Anastasi noted by Betz, occur in Egypt, in the ancient capital 
of Thebes (modern Luxor) and include both Greek and Egyptian documents, but it 
also included documents that were bilingual — some of the spells were written in 
Greek, others in Egyptian, all within the same texts and all for use by the same 
magician. Perhaps even more telling is the fact that even in the spells written in 
Greek, the religious or mythological background and the methodology to be fol- 
lowed to ensure success may be purely Egyptian in origin. Thus it: is only with the 
inclusion of the Egyptian materials together with the Greek, and the study of the 
complete corpus, that the foil ramifications of this extraordinary body of material 
can be studied and appreciated. 

All four of the Demotic magical texts appear to have come from the collections 
that Anastasi gathered in the Theban area. Most have passages in Greek as well as in 
Demotic, and most have words glossed into Old Coptic (Egyptian language writ- 
ten with the Greek alphabet [which indicated vowels, which Egyptian scripts did 
not] supplemented by extra signs taken from the Demotic for sounds not found in 
Greek); some contain passages written in the earlier Egyptian hieratic script or 
words written in a special “cipher” script, which would have been an effective secret 
code to a Greek reader but would have been deciphered fairly simply by an Egyptian. 

The longest of the four Demotic texts was at some time torn into two sections 
(PDM xiv; PGM XIV). The longer second section was acquired by the Leiden Mu- 
seum of Antiquities in 1828; it now bears number P.Lugd.Bat.J 383 (formerly Anas- 
tasi 65). The shorter beginning section was purchased by the British Museum in 
1857; it now bears number P.Lond.demot. 10070 (formerly Anastasi 1072). The 
definitive publication of die two sections, including hand copy, transliteration, and 
translation, with extensive commentary and glossary, is die work of F. LI. Griffith 
and Herbert Thompson. 1 Attention was attracted to die Leiden section very early 
when Reuvens recognized the value that the glosses into Greek letters provided for 
the deciphering of Demotic script. 2 The entire preserved text (both the beginning 
and the end of the original manuscript are lost) consists of twenty-nine large col- 
umns on the recto and thirty-three smaller columns on the verso. All are in Egyp- 
tian with the exception of three short passages in three separate columns, which are 
written in Greek. Elsewhere occasional Greek words occur as glosses to Egyptian 



lvi 



Introduction to the Demotic Magical Papyri 

words or are written in the Egyptian text in an alphabetic Demotic script appar- 
ently developed for writing magical and foreign words. Much more common than 
the Greek passages is the use of the older Egyptian hieratic script in the midst of 
Demotic passages (as if the scribe were transcribing from an earlier manuscript and 
occasionally forgot to update what he was copying) and glosses into Old Coptic, 
most frequently for the writing of magical names and presumably to indicate proper 
pronunciation (which would have been very difficult to do given the abbreviated 
nature and great age of die traditional Egyptian scripts). Each column of the recto 
is written within a frame of horizontal and vertical lines; chapter or section head- 
ings are written in red ink (a tradition in Egyptian literature from Old Kingdom 
times 3 ). In some cases, the scribes, while writing the body of the text in black ink, 
left room for the heading to be added later in red ink but failed to do so. Such 
headings can easily be restored. 

The same scribe who wrote the London and Leiden text also wrote a second 
manuscript in the Leiden Museum ( PDM xii; PGM XII) that contains Demotic 
magical texts — the verso of P.Lugd.Bat.J 384 (formerly Anastasi 75). 4 Of the nine- 
teen columns of magical spells on the verso, the two columns at the beginning (the 
left end of the manuscript) arc purely Demotic, the following thirteen columns are 
in Greek (although two headings arc written in Demotic), the next two columns 
are again in Demotic, and the last two columns at the right end of the papyrus are 
largely in Demotic although they have short passages in Greek cited in the middle. 
(Note that the papyrus is broken at both ends, so it is impossible to determine how 
many more columns there were originally and in what language.) Within the De- 
motic sections of the manuscript are occasional passages written in the earlier hier- 
atic script and in alphabetic Demotic as well as Old Coptic glosses. It appears that 
this text was written before the London and Leiden text since it is in this text that 
one can see the development of the Old Coptic script being used for glosses. In the 
columns at the left end of the papyrus, the Old Coptic glosses were written letter 
by letter above the corresponding Demotic letter. Since the Demotic runs right to 
left, the glosses run the same direction. This would have been quite confusing to 
someone reading what appeared to be Greek, so by the glosses in the second group 
of Demotic spells, at the right end of the papyrus, the scribe had taken to writing 
the glosses word for word, left to right, over the appropriate Demotic word. It is 
this latter system that is found throughout the papyrus of London and Leiden. In 
Leiden J 384, the scribe did not write within a frame or use red ink for headings. 
That both the papyri of London and Leiden and Leiden J 384 were written in 
Thebes, where they were found and sold to Anastasi, is indicated further by the fact 
that the dialect of Coptic to which the glosses and other alphabetic spellings most 
closely correspond has been identified as “archaic Theban.” 5 

The British Museum also contains a second bilingual Greek and Demotic magi- 
cal text ( PDM lxi; PGM LXI), P.Brit.Mus. inv. 105 8 8. 6 The recto contains eight 
columns of Demotic; two have occasional magical names written in Old Coptic 
and one has the names of some ingredients written in Greek in addition to two 
Greek sections within the Demotic. The verso contains two columns of Demotic 
with occasional Old Coptic and four columns of Greek. The Demotic sections use 
red ink for chapter headings (italicized in the translations), as in the papyrus of 
London and Leiden. 

The fourth Demotic magical text is P. Louvre E3229 (formerly Anastasi 1061). 7 
The preserved fragments ( PDM Supplement ) contain seven columns of Demotic on 
die recto and one column on the verso; the papyrus is broken at both ends. Both

the earlier hieratic script and Old Coptic are used, together with the alphabetic De- 
motic script developed for writing magical names and attested in each of these texts 
except P.Brit.Mus. inv. 10588. Section headings are written in red ink on the recto 
(italicized in the translations); the columns on the recto are written within a red 
frame, as in the papyrus of London and Leiden. 

In all four of these texts, all of which can be dated paleographicallv to the third 
century a.d. or only slighdy later, there is every indication that all the various 
scripts were written by, and for, the same scribe, a bilingual person equally at home 
in Egyptian (old, current, and future) and Greek. The contents and the methodol- 
ogy are overwhelmingly Egyptian. Most of the material is completely Egyptian and 
its origins are easily traceable in earlier Egyptian religious and magical literature. 
The methods used are likewise standard Egyptian practices. Some of this is indi- 
cated in die notes to the translations. 

By contrast, Egyptian divinities (in their own names or in the guise of dieir 
Greek counterparts) and Egyptian mythological references abound in the Greek 
texts and Egyptian methodology is also frequent. For example, although threats 
against gods who might fail to do what one wants go back to the earliest Egyptian 
religio-magic literature (Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts), but are unparalleled in clas- 
sical Greece, diey are frequent in the Greek magical texts as well as those written in 
Egyptian. Much of the Egyptian background of the Greek texts has been pointed 
out in die numerous textual notes added by Robert K. Ritner. The common source 
of the Greek and Egyptian language texts is also indicated by their frequent use of 
identical strings of invocation names, including, in addition to Egyptian and Greek 
divinities, western Asiatic divinities, “abracadabra” names, and what appear to the 
modern reader as gibberish. 

Because the bulk of die texts is written in Greek, and because there are short 
passages of Greek in some of the Egyptian texts, 8 it has been suggested that the 
Egyptian texts are translations from the Greek. But there are passages in Egyptian, 
written in Old Coptic, within many of die Greek texts and, as indicated above, the 
religious and magical background of many of the spells, both Greek and Egyptian, 
is decidedly Egyptian. In discussing the Egyptian texts, Griffidi and Thompson 
concluded: “even where there are reasons for believing that the demotic is a transla- 
tion from the Greek, the original source, in relation to magic at any rate, was prob- 
ably Egyptian.” 9 The same may be true for much of the Greek material. One must, 
at any rate, be leery of overstating the Greek case and attributing too much to Greek 
influence. 

The present collection of all the texts, Greek and Egyptian, in one easily usable 
volume, points this out conclusively. This will, in turn, allow and encourage the 
comparative study of the purposes, methods, props, magical names, and the like, of 
the Greek and Egyptian spells and encourage the study of the antecedents of the 
material in both cultures. This work will add greatly to our understanding of the 
cultural milieu in which these magical texts were produced and copied. Thus it is 
the hope of all those who have collaborated on the production of this volume that it 
will both further our knowledge of a dynamic period in the history of man and also 
encourage future study of cultural contact and cross-fertilization.

Pnouthios to Keryx, 13 a god[-fearing man], greetings. As one who knows, I have 
45 prescribed for you [this spell for acquiring an assistant] to prevent your failing / 
as you carry out [this rite]. After detaching all the prescriptions [bequeathed to 
us in] countless books, [one out of all . . . ] I have shown you this spell for acquir-

50 [assistant] and only . . . O friend of aerial / spirits [that move] . . . having per-

8. The section describes the voyage of the sun god, his changing age, and his journey through the 
underworld. See E. Hornung, DasAmduat (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1963). For the forms of the sun 
god, sec H. Brugsch, Thesaurus Inscriptionum A egyptiacanmi (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1883) 405—33. 
[R.K.R.] 

9. The reference is to Ra-Atum emerging from the seas of chaos in the primal month and his creation 
of the gods by masturbation. In the Egyptian view of time this cosmic event occurs continually (8i- 
i)i>ske a>?). Cf. also Pritchard, ANET 6. [R.K.R.] 

10. Ancient religion knew of a large number of sacred fig trees, but little is known about die one in 
Heliopolis. The reference may point to another sacred tree as well, such as the jsd tree (sec L. Kakosv, 
“Ischcdbaum,” LdA 3 [1980] : 182— 83) or the tree “in which is life and death” (idem, LdA 2 [1977] : 
112). Or the tree is the persea tree sacred to Ra (see Herodotus 2. 73; and LdA 3 [1980]: 182-84; 
Bonnet, RARG 83-84, s.v. Darby, Food: The Gift of Osiris 736-40). [R.K.R.] 

11. Walking backwards as a magical rite. Sec PGM IV. 44, 2493; XXXVI. 273. 

12. The term refers to an assistant daimon; see Glossary. Pnouthis and Pnoudiios refer to the same 
person. 

13. Keryx , which means “herald,” may refer to a real or to an ideal person of priesdy or holy status.

an oblong stone, 14 it will immediately take flight and [ascend] to heaven. [You] 
should pick up this stone; carve it at once [and engrave it later]. Once it has been 
engraved, bore a hole in it, pass a thread through and wear it around your neck. But 
in the evening, / go up to [your] housetop [again] and, facing the light of the god- 70 

dess, address to her this [hymnic spell] as you again sacrifice myrrh troglitis 15 in the 
same fashion. Light [a fire] and hold a branch of myrtle . . . shaking it, [and salute] 
the goddess. 

At once there will be a sign for you like this: [A blazing star] will descend and 
come to a stop in the middle / of the housetop, and when the star [has dissolved] 75 
before your eves, you will behold the angel 16 whom you have summoned and who 
has been sent [to you], and you will quickly 17 learn the decisions of the gods. But 
do not be afraid: [approach] the god and, taking his right hand, kiss him and say 
these words to the angel, for he will quickly respond to you about whatever you 
want. But you / adjure him with this [oath] that he meet you and remain insepar- 80 
able and that he not [keep silent or] disobey in any way. But when he has with 
certainty accepted this oath of yours, take the god by the hand and leap down, 

[and] after bringing him [into] the narrow room where you reside, [sit him] down. 

After first preparing the house / in a fitting manner and providing all types of foods 85 
and Mendesian wine, 18 set these before the god, with an uncorrupted boy 19 serving 
and maintaining silence until the [angel] departs. And you address preliminary (?) 
words 20 to the god: “I shall have you as a friendly assistant, a beneficent god 
who serves me whenever I say, ‘Quickly, by your / power now appear on earth to 90 
me, yea verily, god!’” 

And while reclining, you yourself quickly speak about what you propose. 21 Test 
this 22 oath of the god on [what] you wish. But when 3 hours have passed, the god 
will immediately leap up. Order the boy to run [to] the door. And say, “Go, lord, 
blessed god, / where you live eternally, as you will,” and the god vanishes. 95 

This is the sacred rite for acquiring an assistant . It is acknowledged that he is a 
god; he is an aerial spirit which you have seen. If you give him a command, straight- 
way he performs the task: he sends dreams, he brings women, men without the use 
of magical material, he kills, he destroys, he stirs up winds from the earth, he car- 
ries / gold, silver, bronze, and he gives them to you whenever the need arises. And 100

here to myrrh troglitis. jE.N.O.] The name may be commonly referred to as “Ethiopian myrrh.”

17. The adverb, which occurs in PGM I. 76, 79, 91, 108, 111, 113, 116, 121, can mean “precisely” or 
“in detail.” 

18. This is not to be confused with the famous Mendaean wine. Mendesian refers to the Egyptian 
city of Mendes in the Nile Delta. For a discussion of the confusion between the names, see Darby, Food:

he frees from bonds a person chained in prison, he opens doors, he causes invisibil- 
ity so that no one can see you at all, he is a bringer of fire, he brings water, wine, 
bread and [whatever] you wish in the way of foods: olive oil, vinegar — with die 
105 single exception of fish 23 — and he will bring plenty of vegetables, / whatever kind 
you wish, but as for pork, 24 you must not ever tell him to bring this at all! And 
when you want to give a [dinner], tell him so. Conjure up in your mind any suitable 
room and order him to prepare it for a banquet quickly and without delay. At once 
he will bestow chambers with golden ceilings, and you will see their walls covered 
110 with marble— and you consider these things pardy real / and partly just illusion - 
ary — and cosdy wine, as is meet to cap a dinner splendidly. He will quickly bring 
daimons, and for you he will adorn these servants with sashes. These things he does 
quickly. And [as soon as] you order [him] to perform a sendee, he will do so, and 
115 you will see him excelling in other things: He stops ships and [again] / releases 

them, he stops very many evil [daimons], he checks wild beasts and will quickly 
break the teeth of fierce reptiles, he puts dogs to sleep and renders them voiceless. 
He changes into whatever form [of beast] you want: one that flies, swims, a quad- 
ruped, a reptile. He will carry you [into] the air, and again hurl you into the bil- 
120 lows / of the sea’s current and into the waves of the sea; he will quickly freeze rivers 
and seas and in such a way that you can run over them firmly, as you want. And 
[especially] will he stop, if ever you wish it, the sea-running foam, and whenever 
you wish to bring down stars 25 and whenever you wish to make [warm things] cold 
125 and cold things / warm, 26 he will light lamps and extinguish them again. 27 And he 

will shake walls and [cause] them to blaze with fire; he will serve you suitably for 
[whatever] you have in mind, O [blessed] initiate of the sacred magic, and will ac- 
complish it for you, this most powerful assistant, who is also the only lord of the air. 
130 And the gods will agree to everything, for without him / nothing happens. Share 
this great mystery with no one [else], but conceal it, by Helios, since you have been 
deemed worthy by the lord [god].

through it, wear it around your neck.

ungrudgingly, so that I may call upon [it].” It consists of 15 letters: souesolyr 

PHTHE MOTH. 35 

And this is spoken next: “Hither to me, King, [I call you] God of Gods, mighty, 
boundless, undefiled, indescribable, firmly established Aion. / Be inseparable from 
me from this day forth through all the time of my life.” 

Then question him by the same oaths. If he tells you his name, take him by the 
hand, descend and have him recline as I have said above, setting before him part of 
the / foods and drinks which you partake of. And when you release him, sacrifice to 
him after his departure what is prescribed and pour a wine offering, and in this way 
you will be a friend of the mighty angel. When you go abroad, he will go abroad 
with you; when you are destitute, he will give you money. He will tell you what 
things will happen both when and at what time of the night or day. And if / anyone 
asks you “What do I have in mind?” or “What has happened to me?” or even “What 
is going to happen?,” question die angel, and he will tell you in silence. But you 
speak to the one who questions you as if from yourself. When you are dead, he will 
wrap [up] your body as befits a god, 36 but he will take your spirit and carry it into 
the air with him. / For no aerial spirit which is joined with a mighty assistant will 
go into Hades, for to him all things arc subject. Whenever you wish to do some- 
thing, speak his name alone into the air [and] say, [“Come. 1 ”] and you will see him 
actually standing near you. And say to him, “Perform this task,” and he does it at 
once, and after doing it he will say to you, “What else do you want? For I am eager 
for heaven.” If you do not / have immediate orders, say to him, “Go, lord,” and Ire 
will depart. In this fashion, then, the god will be seen by you alone, nor will anyone 
ever hear the sound of his speaking, just you yourself alone. And he will tell you

33. The precise nature of the Anubian cord is not clear. Anubis, the divine undertaker, may have had 
his name applied to thread used in mummification (see also IV. 1083, 2899; XXXVI. 237). See

borne witness to your wisdom and has praised your power highly and has said that 
you have strength in the same way as he, as much strength as he [himself] has. 

“I call upon you, lord of the universe, in an hour of need; hear me, for my soul is

Say this to Helios or whenever you are forced to do so. 41 

*Tr.: E. N. O’Neil. Since the character of this invocation shows no tangible connection with 
the preceding or foregoing spells, it is best understood as a separate charm. Although the 
purpose of this prayer (which at certain points is reminiscent of the language of the Psalms) 
is not exactly stated, 11. 215—16 and 221—22 suggest that deliverance from the onslaught of a 
demonic attack is requested. 



37. Preisendanz’s reading tv<j) vuj> is doubtful because the term is nowhere else attested (see his 
apparatus ad loc.). The word may reflect an Egyptian or Semitic idiom (“son of your own loins”), an 
idiom formed in Greek from the word l(tx lov (hips). The Egyptian term is more general, however, and 
refers to “part of the bodv.” [ J.B.] Cf. also Gn 35 : 1 1 ; 1 Kgs 8 : 19; Acts 2 : 30; Heb 7 : 5, 10. See further- 
more PGM 1 V. 646, 25 19, and Abt, Apologie 65 -66. 

38. Doxai is a name for angels. See also IV. 1051, 1202, and Bauer, s.v. “Sofa,” 4. 

39. The translation of d/3ou[Aos] follows Preisendanz (“ratios”). For the general language of prayer, 
cf. Ps 42 : 6, 12; 43:5; Jon 4 : 9 LXX: Sir 37 : 2; Mk 14 : 34 par. 

40. The concept of Heimarmene is found in PGM here and XIII. 613, 635; cf. 709. See D. Amand, 
Fatalisme ct liberte dans Pantiquite grecque. Recherches sur la survivance de V argumentation morale anti-

them off 45 into spring water / from 7 springs and drink the water on an empty 235 
stomach for seven days while the moon is in the east. But drink a sufficient amount. 

This is the writing on the strip of papyrus', “kambre chambre sixiophi har-

wash the writing off and drink as is prescribed. 

This is also the composition of the ink : myrrh troglitis, 4 drams; 3 karian figs, 7 
pits of Nikolaus dates, / 7 dried pinecones, 7 piths of the single-stemmed worm- 245 
wood, 7 wings of the Hermaic ibis, 46 spring water. When you have burned the in-

* Tested spell for invisibility: A great work. Take an eye of an ape or of a corpse 
that has died a violent death and a plant of peony (he means the rose). Rub these 
with oil of lily, and as you are rubbing / them from the right to the left, 47 say the 250 
spell as follows: “I am anubis, I am osir-phre, 48 I am osot soronouier, I a m 
osiris whom seth destroyed. 49 Rise up, infernal daimon, io erbeth io phobeth 

io pakerbeth io apomps; whatever I, NN, order you to do, / be obedient to me.” 255 
And if you wish to become invisible, rub just your face with the concoction, and 
you will be invisible for as long as you wish. And if you wish to be visible again, 
move from west to east and say this name, and you will be obvious and visible to 
all / men. 260 



42. The pellet (“that which is rolled”) of a scarab is sacred to the sun god Ra. See also PGM VII. 
584. [R.K.R.] 

43. The papyrus reads tpctxvivov, which Preisendanz emends to (6fi)<paKviv ov. For similar expres- 
sions, see PGM IV. 228—29, 3008. For a different reading, see Schmidt, GGA 1931, 445. 

44. This is the myrrh ink of Hermes. 

45. In order to transfer the magical powers of the names, they were washed off and consumed. For 
the widespread practice, sec Handbucb des dsutschen A berglanbens 8 (1936/37) : 1156—57.

* Apollonian 50 invocation : Take a seven-leafed sprig of laurel and hold it in your 
265 right hand / as you summon the heavenly gods and chthonic daimons. Write on the 
sprig of laurel the seven 51 characters for deliverance. 

The characters are these: 0 ■, the first character onto the first 

270 leaf, then the second / again in the same way onto die second leaf until diere is a 
matching up of the 7 characters and 7 leaves. But be careful not to lose a leaf [and] 
do harm to yourself. For this is the body’s greatest protective charm, by which all 
are made subject, and seas and rocks tremble, and daimons [avoid] the characters’ 
275 magical powers which / you are about to have. For it is the greatest protective 
charm for the rite so that you fear nothing. 

Now this is the rite: Take a lamp which has not been colored red and fit it with a 
piece of linen cloth and rose oil or oil of spikenard, and dress yourself in a prophetic 
280 garment and hold an ebony staff in your left hand and / the protective charm in 
your right (i.e., the sprig of laurel). But keep in readiness a wolf’s head so that you 
can set the lamp upon the head of the wolf, and construct an altar of unbumt clay 
near the head and the lamp so that you may sacrifice on it to the god. And imme- 
diately the divine spirit enters. 

285 / The burnt offering is a wolf’s eye, storax gum, cassia, balsam gum and whatever 

is valued among the spices, and pour a libation of wine and honey and milk and 
rainwater, [and make] 7 flat cakes and 7 round cakes. These you are going to make 
290 completely [near] the lamp, robed and refraining from all / unclean things and 
from all eating of fish 52 and from all sexual intercourse, so that you may bring the 
god into the greatest desire toward you. 53 

Now these are the names , [which] you are going to write on the linen cloth and 
which you will put as a wick into the lamp which has not been colored red: “aber- 
295 amenthooulerthexanaxethrenlyoothnemaraibaT 4 / AEMINNAEBARO- 
therrethobabeanimea.’’ 55 When you have completed all the instructions set out 
above, call the god with this chant: 56 



50. This lamp divination is named after the god Apollo. Despite its syncrctistic character, there are 
an unusual number of parallels with the cult of Apollo. See S. Eitrem, “Apollon in der Magic,” in Orakel 
und Mysterien am Ausgang derAntike , Albae Vujiluie 5 (Zurich: Rhcin-Verlag, 1947) : 47-52. 

51. Eight characters arc shown. 

52. See PGM I. 104 and note. 

53. For sexual union with Apollo attributed to the Pythia, see Plutarch, DePyth. or. 405 C— D; Ori- 
genes, C. Cels. 7.3; John Chrysostom, PG 61, p. 242 (hence Schol. Aristoph. Plut. 39; Suda, Lexi- 
con , p. 3120). See G. Wolff, PorphyriiDe philosophia ex oraculis haurienda (Berlin: Springer, 1856) 160; 
W. Burkert, Homo Necans, RW 32 (Berlin: De Gmyter, 1972) 143. | W.B.] 

54. The magical words begin with the name aberamentho, on which see J. Mahe, “Aberamentho,” 
in Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religions, Festschrift for G. Quispel, EPRO 91 (Leiden: Brill, 
1981) '.412— 18. The formula should be read as a palindrome (see Glossary). Cf- also PGM III. 67—68, 
117-18; XXXVIII. 20-21. 

55. The magical word should be read as a palindrome. Cf. also IV. 196-97; XIV. 24; LIX. 7. 

56. These lines contain dactylic hexameters (several of which arc metrically faulty) through I. 311. In 
312— 14 the meter breaks down completely, yet because the tone and the apparent intent is hvmnic, the 
translation continues in a verse pattern that is sometimes faulty. LI. 297—311 (although the identifica- 
tion says 297-314) also form w. 1 - 15 of the reconstructed Hymn 23, while w. 16-18 are taken from

Add also the following [spell], which is to be written on laurel leaves, and to- 
gether with the strip of papyrus on which the Headless One is drawn, it is to be 
placed beside your head, rolled up. It is to be spoken also to the lamp, after you 
come in from the prayer, before going to bed, after you have placed a lump of fran- 
kincense in the wick of die lamp: “boasoch 5 oeae iaoie oiae oiae nicharo-

61. The following dactylic hexameters also form w. 16-18 of the reconstructed Hymn 23 in Prei- 
sendanz, vol. II, p. 262. [E.N.O. j In contrast to the preceding hymn, 11. 341 -47 are Egyptian in charac- 
ter and refer to the sun god’s self-generation and daily travel in his ship. See Homung, Das Amduat , 
passim. See also PGM I. 34. [R.K.R.] 

1. On the wing formation, see PGM 1. 1 1 and n. Here the formula seems to be incomplete. Supply 
(kra kanarba ra kanarba akarnaba) and (a) at the end. Cf. 1. 65 below. 

2. These lines, except for 4—5, arc dactylic hexameters which arc not always metrically correct; thev 
arc the reconstructed Hymn 9, Prcisendanz, vol. II, p. 244. The first three lines appear, in slightly al- 
tered form, at PGM IV. 24-27 (Hymn 10, 4-6). [E.N.O. j 

3. Presumably santaiaia, but there is considerable corruption in the text. 

4. The lines of the following hymn mav have originally been written in some iambic meter. Cf. PGM 
I. 296-97. 

5. In 1. 32 the papyrus gives bolsoch in lieu of boasoch as the beginning of the incantation. One 
or the other is probably wrong. 




PGM II. 1-64

In order to remember wbat is said: Use the following compound. 6 Take the plant 
wormwood, a sun opal, a “breathing stone,” the heart of a hoopoe 7 (also known as 
the “vulture cock”). Grind all these together, add a sufficiency of honey, and anoint 
your lips with the mixture, having first incensed / your mouth with a grain of fran- 20 
kinccnse gum. 

This is the preparation : In the evening, just before retiring, purify your bed with 
ass’s milk, and then, holding in your hands twigs 8 of laurel (the preparation for 
which is given below), speak the invocation given below. Let vour bed be on the 
ground, either upon clean rushes or upon a rush mat, and lie on your right side, on 
the ground and in the open air. While performing the invocation, give answer to 
nobody, and as you are utter ing it, make an offering of a lump of frankincense / and 25 
twelve right-whorled 9 pinecones and 2 unblemished [gizzard stones of a] rooster, 
one to Helios and one to Selene, on the first day [of the month], on a censer 10 of 
bronze or of earth. On your right inscribe this character, 11 and go to sleep in line 
with the upper stroke of it. While praying, wear a garland of laurel of the following 
description: Take 12 laurel twigs; make a garland of 7 sprigs, and bind the remain' 
ing five together and hold them in your right hand while you pray, / and lie down 30 
to sleep holding this, in the above-mentioned position. Inscribe the character with 
myrrh ink, such as is shown to you [below], with a . . . feather [or pen], 12 and hold 
it, along with the laurel, while you are uttering in prayer the words which begin 
“bolsoch,” etc. 13 

The names to be written on the sprigs, on each leaf: “yessemmigadon orthc> 
BAUBO NOERE SOIRE SOIRE SANKANTHARA ERISCHIGAL SANKISTE DODEKAKISTE 

akrourobore kodere” / (write 12 names). 35 

The ink is as follows: In a purified container burn myrrh and cinquefoil and 
wormwood; grind them to a paste, and use them. Take a sprig of laurel and Ethio- 
pian cumin and nightshade, and grind them together; take in a clay pot water from 
a new well, dug either 5 months previously or within the last 5 years, or any one 
you come across on the first day after its being dug, and throw the mixture into the 
water. Leave it for just 3 nights, and, as you are uttering the invocation, put a little 
of it into your / right ear. 40 

To achieve a good memory : Write on a leaf of cinquefoil the following character, 
written with myrrh ink, and keep it in your mouth while you sleep. 

The character is:' 4 € 

Start saying the aforementioned invocation at the 7th hour of the moon, until 
the god hearkens to you, and you make contact with him. 

And these are the compulsive [procedures] : All of them may be brought before 
the moon after the first or second day. / If he does not appear, sacrifice the brain of 45 

6. crvvth'.fjia as a variant of mtvd-qfioL may also have the meaning of “token” or “sign.” 

7. Cf. Horapollo, Hier. 1. 55, and the use of the hoopoe in a magical recipe in PDM xiv. 116. See 
Crum, Coptic Dictionary 102, s.v. [R.K.R.] 

8. xkabos is normally to be translated “branch,” but that seems to convey the notion of something 
larger than can be envisioned here. “Twig” may be better, but it mat' sound too small. The reader must 
think of a small branch. 

9. SEftove is cither “right-turning” or simpiv “perfect in shape.” Cf. PGM III. 694; XIII. 10. 

10. &vfjuaTr)f)toi> is propcrlv an incense burner, hut here perhaps simpJv a word for “altar.”

a black ram, and on the third day the little nail of its right forefoot, the one nearest 
to the ankle; on the fourth, the brain of an ibis; on the fifth, write the figure 
sketched below 15 on papyrus with myrrh ink, wrap it in a piece of clothing of one 
50 who has died violently, and throw it into the furnace of a bathhouse 16 / (some, 
however, [throw it] not into a furnace, for that is too extreme, but they suspend it 
over a lamp, or place it beneath one). 

In another [text] I have found the following: If then, he does not hearken to this 
method, wrap up the figure in the same piece of cloth, and throw it into the furnace 
of a bathhouse on the fifth day, saying after the invocation: “abri and abro exan- 
tiabil, God of gods, king of kings, now force a friendly daimon of prophecy to 
come to me, lest I apply worse tortures to you, the things written on the strips of 
papyrus.” / 

55 If even after this he does not hearken, pour fine, pure oil of radishes over an un- 

corrupted boy, who has been tested, 17 and having gathered it up again, prepare a 
lamp not painted red, and set it upon a lampstand fashioned from virgin soil (some 
authorities say to pour some of the oil on the altar also). If you feci a blow, 18 chew 
up the cumin and drink it down with some unmixed wine. 

60 Write the prescribed figure / as given above, along with the characters and the 
prescribed spell twice with myrrh ink on hieratic papyrus. And of these, one you 
should hold as you make your invocation, as you go to sleep grasping it in your 
right hand, and placing it under your head, while the other, if the necessity arrives 
for the compulsive [procedure], you should roll up in the aforementioned cloth and 
use as prescribed. 

*Tr.: John Dillon and E. N. O’Neil (hymnic sections, 11. 2—4; 5-10) 

PGM II. 64—183 

65 *An alternative procedure : Take a sprig of laurel and write the / 2 names on its 
leaves, the one: “[akrakanarba] krakanarba rakanarba akanarba kanARBA 
anarba narba area rba ba a”; the other: “santalala antalala ntalala tal- 
ala ai ala laia ala la a.” 19 

Take another sprig with twelve leaves on it, and inscribe on it the following 
heart-shaped name, 20 while you begin with a sacred utterance. This is as fallows : 
70 .... And make of the sprig inscribed with the two names / a garland for yourself, 

weaving about it a binding consisting of white wool, bound at intervals with red 
wool, and let this hang down as far as the collarbone. You shall hang a similar bind- 
ing also from the twelve-leaved sprig, and present yourself to the god in the follow- 
ing manner: Take a completely white cock and a pinecone; pour wine upon it, 
75 anoint yourself and remain praying / until the sacrifice 21 is extinguished. Then rub

magic. See Kropp, Koptische Zaubertexte I, SI— 52; II, 32; J. H. Johnson, OMRM 56 (1975): 44-45. 
See also PDAIxii. 149. [R.K.R.] 

17. yvfxva'Qojxsv^ means literally “trained” or “practiced.” But cf. PDM xiv. 287 and csp. xiv. 68, 
where a boy’s sexual purity is stressed. Hence the accompanying use of o’lfihjpto here. 

18. What seems to be envisioned is something akin to an electric shock. Cf. VII. 230. [ J.M.D.] Cf. 
also 2 Sm 6 : 7. 

19. Cf. above, II. 1—5. Each name is to be uttered in “wing formation,” leaving off one letter from 
the beginning in sequence. See 1. 11 and n. 

20. The heart-shaped name is lost, but presumably it resembled the allegedly twelve-part inscription 
given at 11. 33-35 above. Cf. HI. 70, “in the shape of a heart, like a bunch of grapes.” 

21. Cf above, 11. 24ff.

nightshade, and “Hermes’ finger.” You shall also speak into the lamp the following: 
“PERPHAENO . . . DIAMANTHO . . . L DIAMENCHTHOTH 22 PERPERCHRE OANOUTH 
PHROUMEN THORPSOU.” 

The operative name 23 is : “akti kara abaioth, O lord god, servant of god, who 
are in control of this night, stand by me, Apollo Paian.” 

Go to sleep with your head toward the south. / Use this at the time of sunrise, 24 80 
when the moon is in Gemini: 

Fourth Invocation : 25 

“Laurel, 26 Apollo’s holy plant of presage. 

Whose leaves the scepter-bearing lord once tasted 
And sent forth songs himself, Ieios, 

Renowned Paian, who li ve in Kolophon, 

Give heed to holy song. And quickly come 
To earth from heaven and converse [with me]. 

Stand near and from ambrosian lips inspire 

My songs; come, / lord of song, yourself; renowned 85 

Ruler of song. Hear, blessed one, heavy 
In wrath and stern. Now, Titan, hear our voice. 

Unfailing one, do not ignore. Stand here,

(Speak while the sun is rising). 

Greeting formula: 27

22. menchthoth is equivalent to mnh Dhwty, “Thoth is excellent/ beneficent.” [R.K.R. | 

23. On the significance of the term Kvptov ovopa, see Philo, Leg. alleg. 1. 75; Det. 22; 83; Plant. 
74. For the doctrine of the sacred name, see also Iamblichus, Myst. 7.4—5. 

24. The exact significance is not clear, but cf. PGM VI. 4-5, where a very similar hymn is to be 
recited at sunrise. See also Philo, Vit. cont. 89; Apuleius, Met. 11.20. 

25. The basic form of the lines in this passage is metrical, but the dactylic hexameters are frequently 
interrupted by voces magicae and brief statements in prose. LI. 81—102, 107, 132—40, 163—66 have 
been combined to reconstruct Hymn 11. Sec Preisendanz, vol. II, pp. 245—46. LI. 81-82 (Hymn 11. 
1—2) appear also at PGM VI. 6—7 (Hymn 13. 1—2) and 81 also appears at PGM XIL 87-93. [E.N.O.] 

26. For the role of laurel in magic, see L. Deubncr, Kleine Scbriften zur Klassischen Altertumskunde 
(Konigstein: Hain, 1982) 401—3. 

27. The papyrus reads yct-tpE, “hail,” which Preisendanz understands as an abbreviation of yatps- 
TKrjtto?, “greeting formula.” Sec on this A. Baumstark, “Chairetismos,” RAC 2 (1954) : 993—1006. The 
hymn that follows is written in hexameters, although toward the end of the passage the meter falters. 
The hymnic section drat begins in 1. 101, “I call upon you . . . ,” may be in prose; however, cf. PGM IV. 
26 Iff., where ere is used repeatedly as the first word of a hexameter and where Kak(e)oi follows ere three 
times. 

28. Surrere? properly means “fallen from Zeus or heaven,” referring to water, but the term is widely 
used to mean simply “divine.” Here some of the original meaning seems appropriate. Sec Bauer, s.v. 
“5to7T£T7}9;” Betz, Lukian 168 n. 2.

32. Cf. Apulcius’ description of the Olympiaca stola in Met. 1 1. 24, and Griffith’s commentary. The 
Isis-Book 308—14. The bird may be the phoenix, for which cf. PGM XII. 231; XIII. 881. See on the

only attested here. However, in view of the genitive vSctT <nv following the vox majjica, which seems to 
need a governing noun, Preisendanz emends to nokv<po)(TE K^iara. 

37. For similar formulas see PGM V. 485; XII. 80; XIII. 805ff.; XXI. 25. The formula beginning 
“aberamen ...” (see Glossary;) should be read in Preisendanz’s text as a long palindrome.

24-25. See I. 263 and n. 

39. The spacing of this formula has been changed to conform to the spacing of the same formula 
found elsewhere in die PGM (see I. 141-42; III. 77- 78, 151-52, etc.). 

40. For the ritual concerning the doorposts cf. the Jewish mezuzab , for which see Ex 12 : 7, 22—23;

2. For this type of accusation, see PGM III. 113-14; IV. 2475 and n. 

3. The letters barbath laOb A t nchooochn i aboa ithab rab form a palindrome. BAINCHOOOCH 
(“soul of Khukh,” the god of darkness) is often read separately, but is adapted to this form for numcro- 
logical reasons: the formula adds up to 3663.

and bury it. Light seven lamps upon [7] unbaked bricks, and make an offering, 
fumigating storax gum to it, and be of good cheer. 7 / Take its body [and preserve] it 25

and by the names that apply to you; perform the NN deed 1 ’ (add the usual). 

Then take up the water in which the drowning took place, and sprinkle it [on] 
the stadium or in the place where you are performing [the rite]. 

The formula to be spoken , while you are sprinkling the drowning water, is as fol- 
lows: “I call upon you, Mother of all men, / you who have brought together the 45

6. fxovoLTOip is a late word for fioodfirtv^, “horse with a single frondet,” i.e., a racehorse. Presumably 
one drew crude representations of them, along with their names, on a sheet of papyrus. Cf. such figures 
on the so-cailed Serbian curse tablets in R. Wiinsch, Sethianiscbe Veifluchungstafeln am Rom (Leipzig; 
Tcubner, 1899), esp. 51. 

7. Cf. PGM IV. 2390 for a similar injunction to perform a rite with good cheer. See also Plutarch, De 
tranq. an. 20, p. 477E, and R. Bultmann, TDNT 2 (1976) ; 772-75 s.v. “ewppmt'eu.” 

8. The papyrus reads . . . ope. Eitrem suggests rvpapve. 

9. It is not clear whether iaktore is a magical word or something sensible. Preisendanz suggests 
otKTwpE as a Greek equivalent of Latin adores , “drivers,” but in that case the syntax is unclear. 

10. Emended and restored with plausibility from PGM III. 78— 79, 513— 14, 545 —46; IV. 339—40; 
LXVII. 13. 

11. Although attested in LSJ, s.v. u apKviaP as an epithet of the goddess Hekate with uncertain 
meaning (with reference to Audollent, Dcfixionum Tabellae 38. 14 [third cent. A.D.]), “the netter” is a 
standard Egyptian underworld daimon. See D. Bidoli, Die Spruche derFangnetze (Gliickstadt: Augustin, 
1976); J. Zandee, Death as an Enemy (Leiden; Brill, 1960) 226—34. [R.K.R.] 

12. The term veKvia is also attested in this sense only in PGM IV. 2781, but necessarily having some 
such meaning. 

13. The name Hermekatc is a combination of Hermes and Hekate. See Wiinsch, Defixionum Tabcl- 
lae , nos. 104-7. Here in the papyrus the name could also be read Hcrmekateleth, that is, with the typi- 
cal ending -eth\ thus Eitrem in the apparatus to III. 37. 

14. amoy at the beginning is Coptic for “come!” [R.K.R.] 

15. TTPEvparono^ is a form not otherwise attested; cf PGM XIII. 525; EfX 7 TPF.vfj.aTbji)r}. 

16. A plausible restoration is iao in that iao and sabaoth form a common pairing in the PGM.

20. A reference to the solar bark of Re. See PGM III. 98- 105. [R.K.R. j 

21. Seth plays here the role of the defender of the bark of Re. See H. tc Velde, Seth, God of Confusion 
(Leiden: Brill, 1967) 99-108. [R.K.R.] 

22. Or, “for other uses.” Cf. the list of uses at PGM XIII. 230—333. 

23. A reference to a place from where the sunset can be viewed. 

24. For the halting of the soiar bark, cf. lamblichus, Myst. 6.5 and B. Ebbcll, Papyrus Ebers (London: 

Oxford University Press, 1937) 70-71. [R.K.R.] 

25. Cf. PGM ill. 81 and n. 

26. Egyptian mn-nfr , “established and beautiful,” an epithet of Memphis. [ J.B.] 

27. For this type of accusation see PGM III. 5; IV. 2475 and n. 

28. Probably the meaning is “by the Hebrew sound” and refers to the vowel combinations with lao. 

See also Blau, Das altjudische Zaubcrxvesen 128-37; O. Eissfcld, “Jahwe-Name und Zauberwcsen,” 

in his Kleine Schriftm 1 (Tubingen: Mohr, Siebeck, 1962) 150-71. On the use of “barbaric language” 

(p'ijcrt? fiapfiapiKT)) generally, see Hopfncr, OZ I, sections 706-69; Betz, Lukian 153-54. 

29. This peculiar expression is found also in PGM IV. 262; cf. VII. 302—4; XXXVI. 342-49 and 
perhaps IV. 1456; XIII. 291; XIXa. 11. 

30. Probably referring to the Egyptian goddess Satis. See Bonnet, RARG 670-71, s.v. “Satis.”

This is the ritual of the cat , [suitable] for every ritual purpose: A charm to re- 
strain charioteers in a race , a chm~m for sending dreams , a binding love charm , 
and a charm to cause separation and enmity. 

*Tr.: J. M. Dillon. This elaborate spell, a charm suitable for a number of purposes (all of 
which are forms of malicious magic), is set forth with special reference to its use in chariot 
races; it is understood, however, that the additional functions, as stated at die end of die 
spell, also prove useful to the practitioner, provided that he supply in the required places the 
appropriate requests.

32. Reading Xtj3i>/36p<p, a compound found nowhere else; it probably means “west.” 

33. It is not dear whether this damaged word is a vox magica or a Greek word. 

34. Mouroph is a name of the hour god in PGM IV. 1690 (the god of the eleventh hour, having the 
form of an ibis). 

35. Forms of this logos occur in PGM IV. 1010; XII. 190; XIII. 780, 820. The final name Kmeph is 
an epithet of Osiris and is the equivalent of the Egyptian hm% “his shrine.” Cf. satraphrkmeph in 
PGM XII. 185; XIII. 915. 

36. The phrase is equivalent to the Egyptian ps sy c 3 pi sy <3 pj ntr *23 ntr. tv tr. w, “Good Daimon, 
Good Daimon, O god of all the gods!” psoeio should be the usual psalas. fR.K.R.] 

37. For the sun as an egg, cf. PGM XII. 1 00- 106. On the cosmic egg, see J. Bergman, Isis-Seele und 
Isis-Ei (Uppsala: Almqvist and Wiksell, 1970) 73-102; Morenz, Egyptian Religion 177—79. [R.K.R.] 

38. This formula has been misread and is here emended on the basis of PGM I. 141—42; II. 138— 
39; III. 77- 78. Preisendanz has IAB BA at the beginning. The lambda has been misread for a chi. 

39. The papyrus has [.]«[.] Ba/xwov, which Preisendanz restores to read [*:]«[/}] boquvov, an unat- 
tested adjectival form of napda/xov, “nose-smart” (thus LSJ, s.v.; a mustardlike plant). However, 
Schmidt, GGA 1931, 450 suggests [/3ja[A] crapivov , “balsam wood.” Cf. PGM XII. 364. 

40. A variant of the name osirchentechtha. Sec also PGM VII. 257. The name corresponds to 
Egyptian Osiris-khenty-kbet , a combination of Osiris and Khcntv-khet, the local god of Athribis, who in 
the text is joined together with Osiris, Horus, and Apis. See Bonnet, RARG 131—33, s.v. “Chen- 
techtai.” [R.K.R.]

*Tr.: J. M. Dillon. This fragmentary portion of PGM III begins another untitled spell which 
probably ends at line 186, since line 187 begins a new column (col. VIII) in die papyrus 
manuscript. Although the exact purpose of this short spell cannot be determined, its func- 
tion may be similar to that of the spell to follow, viz., an oracular request.

* Pound up dry fruit (?) 42 with a pestle (?) 4 -’ and mix it to sufficiency with honey 
and [oil of] a date palm. Grind up a magnet. Boil all together and pulverize it. 

Make little rounds, as many as you wish, / but put an ounce of each element of the 190 
mixture into each of these, and proceed thus, singing a hymn of praise to the god. 

Then the deity will come to you, shaking the whole house and the tripod 44 before 
him. Then he will bring about 45 your enquiry into the future, being dear in his 
intercourse with you, 46 as long as you wish, / and then dismiss the god with thanks. 195 
The drawing of the tripod : 




Tins is the prayer of encounter of the rite which is recited to Helios : 47 
“Keep silent, everyone, the voice that’s in 
Your mouths; O circling birds of air, keep quiet; / 

Cease frolicking, you dolphins, o’er the brine. 200 

Stand for me, river streams and fountain [flows]. 



41. Supplying [ ovpo0]opo$ in the lacuna. [R.D.K.] 

42. ra gvpa. Preisendanz translates on the basis of a gloss in Hesvchius, {vpov> “cutting, dry, sharp.* 
But perhaps we are to understand simply gvkat, “pieces of wood,” assuming a confusion oflambda and 
rho. The definite article, however, suggests the pieces of wood were previously mentioned, in which case 
this spell would be connected to the preceding (cf. 1. 165). 

43. The papyrus has <rxo(t?ravov, a word otherwise unattested and meaningless. Preisendanz 
emends to KOfAiravov, “strawberry tree,” a rather radical change. Perhaps we should read kottcxvov , 
“pestle,” the sigma being an error, and the mu intrusive, as it often is with pi. This, however, would have 
to be a genitive used instrumentally, which is troublesome. 

44. This tripod has not been mentioned before, but it is obviously central to the ceremony (cf. U. 
291-96 below). Perhaps we can assume the tripod is a part of the magician’s basic equipment (see PGM 
IV. 1890-91; 1S97; V. 200-201; XIII. 104, 661, etc.). 

45. Reading future rekei instead of imperative Tsket. The phrase that follows (rpar'fi? rfj 6/x<|T]ia) 
seems to make better sense if it refers to the god. Cf. PGM II. 83-84, where 6p.ik<bv is used of the god 
consorting with the magician. 

46. On Apollo’s epiphany cf. Callimachus, Hy. 2.1-2. [W.B. j 

47. The following dactylic hexameters arc also the reconstructed Hymn S. See Preisendanz, vol. II, 
pp. 241-42. [ E.N.O.J

48. The name Semea also appears at PGM III. 29, where it is fem., and at V. 429; PDM xiv. 214 
among the voces magicac. Despite the designation “King” here, Semea elsewhere is a Syrian goddess 
whose name appears in various forms on numerous votive inscriptions. She is identified with several 
deities, e.g., Astarte, Athena, Hera. Semea does not appear in Greco-Roman literary writings except 
perhaps in Ps.-Lucian, De Syr. Dea 33 (yet the text is uncertain), where it is suggested she is Semiramis. 
There is also a Syrian god Seimios. See O. Hofer, in Roscher IV, 601; R. Dussaud, “Simea und Simios,” 
PRE, second scries 5 (1927) : 137-40; W. Fauth, “Simla,” KP 5 (1979) : 200. [E.N.O.] 

49. The papyrus reads d[p]oiyoi' cron MpyafiX], which is unmetrical. Heitsch would excise apcoy 6v 
crow; Prciscndanz would excise peyterrs at the beginning of the line, and write MtxapX crou dpwyoi/, 
which would restore the meter. “Michael” is a restoration, but a probable one; cf. PGM I. 301. 

50. ae.£ov7ct, the emendation of Wunsch, is preferable to d sip a ora for two reasons: (1) it corrects 
the meter and (2) it restores the proper sense, for whatever is written must govern <pvaiv in both clauses. 
In any case, ae^ovra must be taken as a zeugma. [E.N.O.] 

5 1 . Fahz reads sottl in lieu of oerrt, “you are almightv god.” 

52. eTTLrjKSTrafa is properly “to cover over,” hence "Veil.” It may, however, be a solecism for etrt- 
rTKETT-ofiai, “look upon,” the sense required here (cf. Prcisendanz: “beschaut”). Cf. PGM I. 303, ettl- 
(TKOTTial.Ets, which is at least metrical, though the verb is not elsewhere attested. [E.N.O.j 

53. The readings of the papyrus are quite uncertain here. See the restoration by Heitsch in Preisen- 
danz, vol. II, pp. 241-42 (Hymn 5).

Also say this : “Send me the daimon who will give responses to me about every-

54. O, “I adjure you [by] the god’s seal.” Sec PGM I. 306 and n. 

55. In Hymn 5, Preiscndanz concludes with ceKOuei, but the following words seem part of the hymn 
for two reasons: (1) they arc almost metrically sound, and (2) they seem to have a poetic sense. [E.N.O.j 

56. This hymn is extremely fragmentary in the papyrus. Here the suggested restoration by Heitsch is 
followed. See Preiscndanz, vol. II, p. 247 (Hymn 12). [E.N.O.j 

57. This passage contains what appears to be dactylic hexameters, many of which arc fragmentary 
while others are completely missing. [E.N.O.J 

58. The papyrus has jeoXeTOKru-n-s, which Preiscndanz (vol. II, p.247 [Hymn 12]) restores as

And the formula is: “Lord, if you [wish me to know in advance], let the falcon 
[descend] onto the tree.” If it does not happen, also speak this formula to the four 
winds while you turn around [toward] die wind. 63 Whenever you say the formula,

necessary to keep yourself pure for three days in advance. The shrine and the [tri-

68. Fahz and Prciscndanz take Kakov as modifying i)vfjMX7T)piov , “a beautiful censer.” Here Kakov 
has been taken with eotlp ktA.., and the text has been punctuated accordingly. Cf. also PGM IV. 2520 
and Bauer, s.v. “/caXoc,” 3. a. 

69. The text at this point has many lacunae, and the reconstruction is uncertain. Fahz and Preisen- 
danz take the reference to the garments and the laurel to refer to the god who is seen. 

70. LSJ, s.v. TjXioyopos, crskiqvoyovos translates these epithets accordingly. However, since se- 
lenagmum is attested as a plant (peony) and since a plant name would be appropriate here, one should 
perhaps translate “peony.” “Sun-bom” is not attested as a plant name. 

71. thoouth pio pio (cf. also 1. 340) is equivalent to Egyptian Dhwtyp 3 c 3 c 3, “Thoth the twice - 

great.” Cf. PGM IV. 19. For this tide of Thoth, sec J. D. Ray, The Archive ofHor (London: Egypt Explo- 
ration Society, 1976) 158-60; R. K. Ritner, “Hermes Pentamegistos,” Gottinger Miszellen 49 (1981) : 
73-75. [R.K.R.] 

72. Following G. Mollcr (see the apparatus in Preisendanz ad loc.) this short secrion can also be read 

as Coptic: “|I am] Thoth; I am Sa[.]out; I am Em| je[ ]on; I am Alaboul| ]ldrai; I am (?) Na-

*A copy from a holy book. Charm that gives foreknowledge and memory: 

Take a kakouphon, 85 / which in Egyptian is kakkou[phat, tear out] its heart, perfo- 425 
rate it with a reed, [cut] die heart [into pieces], and put them into Attic honey 
when the goddess 86 approaches. Then grind the heart on the 1st of the goddess, 87 
mix it with the honey, [and eat it] on an empty stomach while saying seven times, 
once while tasting with the forefinger, this formula: 

“Make me know in advance once and for all the things that are going to happen, 
the things that are about to happen, the things that have been done, and all [to- 
day’s] activities.” 

Say the name seven times, and quickly say / the other usual formulas. . . . 88 430 

76. That is, Helios, the sun god. 

77. The papyrus has Karax^o'aT], “p our it,” which is not meaningful here. Schmidt, GGA 193 
(1931) :451-52, suggests KarakEct^eiv on the basis of Hesychius’ dkedC,eii‘, “to heat up.”The transla- 
tion here follows the text of Preisendanz. 

78. Schmidr, GGA 193 (1931 ) : 451, adds (els), “into,” which seems necessary to complete the sense 
of the phrase, viz., “put it (into] a clean vessel.” 

79. It seems only twelve pastry dolls are to be shaped and not an additional loaf and piece of pastry 7 , 
as Preisendanz seems to take it. [R.D.K.] 

80. That is, Selene, the moon goddess. 

81. Probably Coptic pcosm [ pejhmiit , “the first darkness.” [M.W.M.] 

82. Probably read Gehenna. [M.W.M.] 

83. Perhaps Coptic, meaning “Jesus our great one.” [M.W.M.] 

84. The blessing given in response to the procedure. Cf. PGM IV. 198. See also A.-J. Fcstugiere, “La 
Valcur religieu.se dcs papyrus magicjues,” in his L’Idcal religieux des Grecs ct PEvangile (Paris: Gabalda,

inserted.

102. Pliny identifies TroahEposs as an opal (NH 37. 84) or an amethyst (NH 37. 123). It has been 
rendered here as amethyst because in 37.80 Pliny says opals come only from India. See the note by D. E.

107. The papyrus reads KaTaTETifXT]fjLsv7)\y], a verb not attested elsewhere. The meaning could also 
be “despised.” Preiscndanz suggests that the widow is Isis and the magician identifies himself with 
Horns. Probably, the translation “dishonored” is to be preferred, because it would refer to the murder of 
Isis’ husband and her subsequent flight to the swamps of Chcmmis to raise her son Horns. For Horus as 
orphan, see Borghouts, Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts 69, no. 92. [R.K.R.]

* [If you make] an offering of whcaten meal and ripe mulberries and unsoftened 123 
(?) sesame and uncooked tbrion and throw into this a beet, you will gain control of 
615 your own shadow 124 / so that it [will serve] you. Go at the sixth hour of the day, 
toward [the rising sun], to a deserted place, girt about with a [new] dark-colored 
palmfiber basket, and on your head a scarlet cord as a headband, behind your right 
620 ear / the feather of a falcon, behind your left that of an ibis. 

Having reached the place, 125 [prostrate] yourself, stretch out your hands, and 
utter the following formula : “Cause now my shadow to serve me, because I know 
625 your sacred names [and] your signs and / your symbols, and [who you are at each 
hour], and what your name is.” 126 

Having said this, [utter] the formula given above, 127 and in case he does not 
[hearken, say]: 128 “I have uttered your sacred names and [your signs] and your sym- 
630 bols, wherefore, O lord, 120 cause / my [shadow] to serve me.” [And] at the seventh 
[hour] it will come to you before [your] face, and you address it [and say] : “Follow’ 
me everywhere!” But [look] to it, that it not leave you. 

*Tr. J. M. Dillon. Sec the introductory note on PGM III. 494-611. This unique spell to 
acquire control over one’s shadow may be part of the whole Encounter with Helios con- 
tained i n II 1 . 494 — 731. The Coptic section to follow ( PGM III. 633— 731) belongs with this 
section, and the mention of the “signs and symbols” in 1. 625 connects this spell to die pre- 
ceding; furthermore, the mention of die “formula given above” (1. 626) must refer to a for- 
mula given in the preceding spell, probably the formula found in III. 494ff. The appearance 
of one’s shadow is thus the proof of Helios’ appearance requested in PGM III. 494-731.

133. Apparent instructions for the repetition of the formulas either forward or backward. Cf. 11. 667, 
669, 682. But if this is the equivalent of Greek koivov (see Preisendanz’s text at 1. 682), we are to under- 
stand “(add die usual)”; thus the translation, as in several instances below.

* Initiation: 14 Keep yourself pure for 7 days beforehand. On the third of the 
month, go to a place from which the Nile has recently receded, before anyone walks 
on the area that was flooded — or at any rate, to a place tit at has been inundated by 
the Nile. / On two bricks iS standing on their sides, build a fire with olive wood 30 
(that is, with a branch of it) when half of the sun is above the horizon; but before 
the sun appears, dig a trench around the altar. When the disk of the sun is fully 
above the horizon, / cut off the head of an unblemished, solid white cock which 35 
[you are to carry] under your left arm (and do dig the trench around 16 the altar 
before the sun appears). 17 When you arc beheading the cock, fix it in place [with 
your knees] 18 and hold it down all by yourself. / Throw the head into the river and 40 
drink up the blood, draining it off into your right hand and putting what’s left of 
the body on the burning altar. Then jump into the river. Immerse yourself in the 
clothes you have on, walk backwards 19 out of the water, and, after changing into 
fresh garments, / depart without turning round. 20 After this, take bile from an owl, 45 
rub some of it over your eyes with the feather of an ibis, and your initiation will be 
complete. But if you can’t get hold of an owl, use an ibis’s egg and a falcon’s 
feather. / Bore a hole in the egg, insert the feather, break it open, and thereby get 50 
the fluid to rub on yourself.

10. The location is unknown. Cf. Ha-si-ise-t , “house of the son of Isis.” See A. H. Gardiner ? Ancient 
Egyptian Onomastica (London: Oxford University Press, 1968) II, 29* (no. 341A). One conjecture is 
that of Brugsch, Dictiannaire 659, who has identified Hansiese as a site (Chcnoboskia?) near Koptos and 
Dendera in Upper Egypt. 

11. This refers to an ancient title of Anubis. Cf. PDM xiv. 174. In this connection one should also 
note the relationship berween mountain , desert, and cemetery in ancient Egypt. 

12. Hebrew for “Lord, Lord of Hosts;” ABRA may be a variation of arba (Heb. “four”) designating 
the tetragrammaton. Sec Blau, Das altjiidische Zauberwescn 126; Domseiff, Das Alphabet 64; A. Barb, 
“Abraxas- Studien,” in Hommages a W. Deonna (Bruxelles: Latomus, 1957) 67-86. 

13. Or “jeakshha shha”; but cf. PGM IV. 77, also III. 658, 659, 661, 667, 673, etc., for other 
examples of the common formula “for ... is my name” or “for I am. ...” 

14. The purpose of this rite is not clear (cf. 1. 48). It may have simply been a part of the longer ritual 
of the context. 

15. On the magical use of bricks for both the living and the dead, see J. Monnet, “Les Briques ma- 
giques du Musccdu Louvre,” Remre d'Egyptohgie S (1951) : J51—62. [R.K.R.] 

16. Or “dig a trench around,” which may in fact mean “walk around” and refer to the ritual circum- 
ambulation. See W. Pax, “Circumambulatio,” RAC 3 (1957) : 143—52. 

17. Sec 1. 33 above. 

18. The phrase “with your knees” is a conjecture based on PGM IV. 227-28. 

19. Cf. the injunctions to walk backwards at PGM I. 37; IV. 2493; XXXVI. 273. 

20. Presumably, the initiate is to turn away from the river after he is our of the water and to depart 
without looking back at the river. Perhaps he is being instructed to depart by walking backwards. The 
text is not entirely clear; cf. for similar circumstances PGM VII. 439-40, For looking back and its con- 
sequences, cf. the story of Lot’s wife (Gn 19:17, 26) and the injunction in Lk 17:31-32; Mt 24:

*Keep yourself pure for 7 days before the moon becomes full by abstaining from 
meat and uncooked food, by leaving behind during die prescribed days exactly 
55 half / of your food in a turquoise 21 vessel, over which you are also to eat, and by 

abstaining from wine. When the moon is foil, go by yourself to the eastern section 
60 of your city, village, or house and throw out / on the ground the leftover morsels. 

Then return very quickly to your quarters and shut yourself in before he 22 can get 
there, because he will shut you out if he gets there before you. But before you throw 
out the morsels, fix in the ground at a slight angle a verdant reed that is about two 
cubits long, tie some hairs from a stallion about the midsection of a horned dung 
65 beede, and suspend / the beetle from die reed by them. Then light a lamp diat has 
not been used before and place it under the beetle in a new earthenware dish, so 
that the heat from the lamp barely reaches the beetle. Stay calm after you have 
70 thrown out the morsels, gone to your quarters, and shut yourself in; / for the one 
you have summoned will stand diere and, by threatening you with weapons, will 
try to force you to release the beetle. But remain calm, and do not release it until he 
gives you a response; then release it right away. And every day during the period of 
purification when you are about to eat and to go to bed, speak the following spell 7 
75 times (you are to say them again / when you return to your quarters after throwing 
out the food). Keep it secret: “You with the wooden neck, you with the clay (?) 
face, 23 come in to me, for I am Sabertoush, the great god who is in heaven .” 

The phylactery for the foregoing: With blood from the hand or foot of a preg- 
80 nant woman, / write the name 24 given below on a clean piece of papyrus; then tie it 
about your left arm by a linen cord and wear it. Here is what is to he written: 
“shteit chien tenha, I bind and loose.” 

The dismissal: When you release the beetle, say: “Harko, Harko is my name; 
Harko is my true name.” 

85 Guard these instructions / well. The rite: an onion. 25

* Phylactery against daimons: 26 “ homenos ohk kouriel iaphel , deliver” (add 
the usual), “ehenperoou barbarchaouche .” 

*Tr.: Marvin W. Meyer. This brief spell seems to have no connection with the preceding or 
following spells. 



21. A bluc-grccn glazed potter)', almost certainly Egyptian faience. See A. Lucas and J. R. Harris, 
Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries (London: Arnold, 1962) 156— 67, esp. 163—64. [R.K.R.] 

22. “He” is the one summoned (1. 70), but “he” is never identified. 

23. Probably referring to a day or terracotta figurine on a wooden pedestal. [M.W.M.] 

24. The “name” may have included not only sabertoush but also the attached epithets: in magical 
texts “name” often means “full title.” The Greek irpov'iroKsifjcEvov normally means “given above,” but it 
can also be read as meaning “set forth below.” This latter interpretation (accepted by Preisendanz) 
would eliminate the apparent contradiction between this and the following sentence. However, the fol- 
lowing sentence may be a deliberate contradiction by a glossator. |M.S.] 

25. This is probably an abbreviated way of saying, “LTsc the procedure that involves an onion.” 

26. Or “For those possessed by daimons,” which seems the better reading of the papyrus. The manu- 
script has 77 pos Sat/£ovta£o/i.£vo(v)y. Sec A. Erman, ZAS 21 (1883) :99 (plate III, 1. 25) and Preisen- 
danz, apparatus ad loc. The invocation which begins with ohk is separated by a space and -^o/xei'o? is 
written with the same Greek letter forms as the preceding ones. [R.D.K.]

* Isis is the one who comes from the mountain at midday 30 in summer, the dusty 

maiden; / her eyes are full of tears and her heart is full of sighs" 95 

Her father, Thoth the Great, came in unto h er and asked her, “O my daughter 
Isis, dusty maiden, why are your eyes full of tears, your heart full of sighs, and [the 
. . .] of your garment soiled? [Away with] the tears of your eyes!” 

She said [to him], “He is not with me, 31 O my father, Ape Thoth, Ape / [Thoth], 100 
my fa ther. I have been betrayed by my female companion. I have discovered [a] 
secret: yes, Nephthys is having intercourse with Osiris . . . my brother, my own 
mother’s son.” 

He said to her, “Behold, this is adultery against you, O my daugh ter Isis.” 

She [said] to him, “It is adultery against you, O my father, / [Ape] Thoth, Ape 105 
Thoth, my father; it is pregnancy proper for me myself.” 32 

He said to her, “Arise, O my daughter Isis, and [go] to the south to Thebes, to 
the north to Abydos. 33 There are . . . those who trample (?) there. Take for yourself 
Belf son of Belf, [the one whose] foot is of bronze and whose heels are of iron,"/ 110 
[that] he forge for you a double iron nail with a . . . head, a thin base, a strong 
point, and light iron. Bring it before me, dip it in the blood of Osiris, 34 and hand it 
over; we . . . this mysterious (?) flame to me.” 

“ / Every flaming, every cooking, every heating, 35 every steaming, and every 115 
sweating that you [masc.] will cause in this flaming stove, you [will] cause in the 
heart, in the liver, [in] the area of the navel, and in the belly of NN whom NN has 
borne, until I bring her to the house of NN whom NN has borne 36 and she puts 
what is in / her hand into my hand, what is in her mouth into my mouth, what is in 120 
her belly onto my belly, what is in her female parts onto my male parts, quickly' 
quickly; immediately, immedi ately. Rise up to the kings of Alchah, 37 speak the truth 
(?) in Oupokc, arouse god [after] NN 38 whom NN has borne, and I shall send 

27. Presumably this is another request for divination (cf. PGM IV. 1—25, 52—85). In fact, the spell is 
specifically a “divination using a boy,” for which cf. PGM VII. 348—58; also Test. Sol. I. 3. 

28. Cf. for this phrase PDM xiv. 96. 

29. That is, Helios, the sun god. 

30. Cf. PDM xiv. 1219. 

31. Or “It is not of my doing.” 

32. This episode is also told in a different fashion by Plutarch, De Is. et Os. 14, 356E— F. See 
Griffiths, Plutarch’s De hide et Osiride 316— 1 7. 

33. Cf. PDM xiv. 628.

37. Alchah (Egyptian 'rq-bb, “Abcai”) and Oupoke (Egyptian w-pkr) are both sacred places at Aby- 
dos. Alchah designates the cemetery where the mummy of Osiris was buried. Sec PGM XlVb, 12 — 15

heart for me, for NN whom NN has borne, on this day.” 

If a large amount of saliva forms in your mouth as you speak, understand that she 
135 is distressed 40 and wants to talk with you; if you yawn frequently, she wants / to 
come to you. But if you sneeze two times or more, she is in good health 41 and is 
returning to where she lives; if you have a headache and are crying, she is dis- 
tressed 42 or even dying. 

LL Rise up to heaven, and arouse the High One [masc.] after the Noble One [fern.]. 
140 Rise up to the abyss, and arouse Thoth after Nabin; arouse / the heart of these two 
bulls, Hapi and Mnevis; arouse the heart of Osiris after Isis; arouse Re after the 
light; arouse the heart of NN whom NN has born e, after NN whom NN has 
borne.” 

[Say] these things on behalf of women. But when [you are speaking] about 
145 women, / then speak, conversely, so as to arouse the females after the males: 

“When she drinks, when she eats, when she has intercourse with someone else, I 
wilFbewitch her heart, I will bewitch the heart of her, I will bewit ch her breath, I 
150 will bewitch / her 365 members, 43 1 will bewitch her inner part . . . wherever I de-

the human body by 365 angels. In PGM the number 365 is commonly associated with the name Abrasax 
and its numerical value (see Glossary, s.v. “Abrasax”), but also with 365 gods or even 365 knots (PGM 
VII. 452-53).

Inquiry of bowl divination and necromancy:^ Whenever you want to inquire 
about matters, take a bronze vessel, either a bowl or a saucer, whatever kind you 
225 wish. Pour water: / rainwater if you are calling upon heavenly gods, seawater if 
gods of the earth, river water if Osiris or Sarapis, springwater if the dead. Holding 
230 the vessel on your knees, pour out green olive oil, bend over the vessel and speak / 
the prescribed spell. And address whatever god you want and ask about whatever 
you wish, and he will reply to you and tell you about anything. And if he has 
spoken dismiss him with the spell of dismissal, and you w ho have used this spell 
wall be amazed. 

235 The spell spoken over the vessel is: “aaioun auantau / laimoutau riptou 
MANTAUI IMANTOU LANTOU LAPTOUMI ANCHOMACH ARAPTOUMI, hither tO me, 
O NN god; appear to me this very hour and do not frighten my eves. Hither to me, 
O NN god, be attentive to me because he wishes and commands this 54 achchor 
240 ACHCHOR / ACHACHACH PTOUMI CHACHCHO CHARACHOCH CHAPTOUME CHO- 
RACHARACHOCH APTOUMI MECHOCHAPTOU CHARACHPTOU CHACHCHO CHA- 

racho ptenachocheu” (a hundred letters). 55 

But you are not unaware, mighty king and leader of magicians, that this is tire 
245 chief name of Typhon, / at whom the ground, the depths of the sea, Hades, heaven, 

the sun, the moon, the visible chorus of stars, the whole universe all tremble, the 
name which, when it is uttered, forcibly brings gods and daimons to it. This is the 
name that consists of 100 letters. Finally, when you have called, whomever you 
250 called will appear, god or dead man, 56 and he will / give an answer about anything 
you ask. And when ytw have learned to your satisfaction, 57 dismiss the god merely 
with die powerful name of the hundred letters as you say, “Depart, master, for the 
great god, NN, wishes and commands this of you.” Speak the name, and he will 
255 depart. Let this spell, / mighty king, be transmitted to you alone, guarded by you, 
unshared. 

There is also the protective charm itself which y r ou wear while performing, even 
while standing: 55 onto a silver leaf inscribe this name of 100 letters with a bronze 
260 stylus, and wear it strung on a thong from the hide / of an ass. 59 



53. Following the emended punctuation by M. Smith, Clement of Alexandria and the Secret Gospel of 
Mark (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973) 221. 

54. The sudden shift to die third person in the words &b\si kolI etrLTaacrei seems strange at first, 
and one is tempted to think that the magician begins to refer to himself in the third person. But cf. 11. 
253-54 below, where the same phenomenon occurs with die subject named. 

55. That is, according to Greek letters. 

56. That is, the spirit or soul of a dead man. See on this primitiv e concept J. Bremmer, The Early 
Greek Concept of the Soul (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983) 70-124: “The Soul of die 
Dead.” 

57. At this point the revelatory dialogue comes into the picture. Cf. Corp. Hcrm. 1.3, 27, 30. Cf. 
P. Perkins, The Gnostic Dialogue: The Early Church and the Crisis of Gnosticism (New York: Pauiist Press, 
1980), where further literature can be found. 

58. The Greek is obscure at diis point. The translation follows Preisendanz: “auch wenn du stehend 
agierst ” 

59. The ass is the animal associated with Seth/Typhon. See Glossary, s.v.

[E.N.O.] 

61 . The papyrus reads dpyikov, which the editors of Hymn 7 have obelized. Here in IV. 262 Preisen- 
danz has emended and reads oirkop, while others have suggested such words as oppav (Wiinsch), 
KO(jp.ov (Dieterich), etc. The translation here has retained the reading of the papyrus. For Siemo and its 
meaning here, see Bauer, s.v. [E.N.O. | 

62. The papyrus has SffXov, which Prcisendanz retains both here and in Hymn 7 where he obelizes 
it. Kroll’s emendation adrjkov is paleographically sound, for “A” could have been omitted before “A.” 
Second, cfSrjXon is a good parallel to api7jxavoi\ and third, the idea of adrjkov fits Seth/Typhon, who is 
regularly associated with darkness, shadow's, etc. Cf., c.g., Plutarch, De Is. etOs. 2, 35 IF; 44, 368F, and 
Griffiths, Plutarch's De Iside et Osiride 468. [E.N.O.] 

63. Preisendanz reads at this point et t' evicrctuav Moipav, “over the Moirai invoked in prayer.” In 
the reconstructed Hymn 7 (Prcisendanz, vol. II, p. 244), Heitsch reads sTTEVKtaicov Motpwr, “of the 
longed-for Moirai,” originally a proposal by Dieterich (sec the apparatus to PGM IV. 271).

* Wondrous spell for binding a lover: Take wax [or clay] from a potter’s wheel 
and make two figures, a male and a female. Make the male in the form of Ares fully 
300 armed, holding a sword / in his left hand and threatening to plunge it into the right 
side of her neck. And make her 66 with her arms behind her back and down on her 
knees. And you are to fasten the magical material on her head or neck. Write on the 
305 figure of the woman being attracted as follows: On the head: / “isee lao ithi 
oune brjdo lothion neboutosoualeth”; on the right ear: “ouer m£Chan”; 
on the left ear: “libaba oimathotho”; on the face: “amounabreo”; on the right 
310 eye: / “orormothio AETH”; on the other: “choboue”; on the right shoulder: 
“ad eta merou”; on the right arm: “ene psa enesgaph”; on the other: “mel- 
315 chiou melchiedia”: on the hands: / “melchamelchou ael”; on the breast: 
the name, on her mother’s side, of the woman being attracted; on the heart: “bal- 
amin thoouth”; and below the lower belly: “aobes aObar”; on tire pudenda: 
320 “blichianeoi ouOia”; on the buttocks: “pissadara”; on / the sole of the right 
foot: “elo”; on the sole of the other one: “eloaiaoe.” 

And take thirteen copper needles and stick 1 in the brain while saying, “I am 
piercing your brain, NN”; and stick 2 in the ears and 2 in the eyes and 1 in the 
325 mouth and 2 / in the midriff and 1 in the hands and 2 in the pudenda and 2 in the 
soles, saying each time, “I am piercing such and such a member of her, NN, so that 
she may remember no one but me, NN, alone.” 

330 And take a lead tablet 67 and write the same / spell and recite it. And tie the lead 
leaf to the figures with thread from the loom after making 365 knots while saying 
as you have learned, “abrasax, hold her fast!” You place it, as the sun is setting, 
beside the grave of one who has died untimely or violendy, placing beside it also the 
seasonal flowers. 

335 The spell to be written / and recited is: “I entrust this binding spell to you,

assistants beside this daimon. And arouse yourself for me, 68 whoever you are,

subject, but no daimons appear in the spell. Can the subject be the voces magicae themselves? [E.N.O.]

nearly identical to that of 11. 335—406, has been found in Egypt. See S. Kambitsis, “Une nouvelle tab-

female. For a characteristic example, see S. Sauneron, Le Papyrus magique illustre de Brooklyn (Brooklyn:

Let her not be had in a promiscuous way, 70 let her not be had in her ass, nor let her

Prayer that belongs to the procedure: At sunset, while holding / the magical ma- 
terial from die tomb, say: 

“Borne 71 on the breez.es of the wandr’ing winds, 

Golden-haired Helios, who wield the flame’s 
Unresting fire, who turn in lofty paths 
Around the great pole, who create all things 
Yourself which you again reduce to nothing, / 

From whom, indeed, all dements have been 
Arranged to suit your laws which nourish all 
The world with its four yearly turning points. 

Hear, blessed one, for I call you who rule 
Heaven and earth, Chaos and Hades, where 
Men’s daimons dwell who once gazed on the light, / 

And even now I beg you, blessed one. 

Unfailing one, the master of the world, 

If you go to the depths of earth and search 
The regions of the dead, send this daimon, 

From whose body I hold this remnant in my hands. 

To her, NN, at midnight hours, 

To move by night to orders ’neatli your force, / 

That all I want within my heart he may 
Perform for me; and send him gentle, gracious 
And pondering no hostile thoughts toward me, 

And be not angry at my potent chants. 

For you yourself arranged these things among 
Mankind for them to learn about the threads 
Of the Moirai, and this with your advice. / 

I call your name, Horus , 72 which is in number 
Equivalent to those of the Moirai, 

ACHAIPHO THOTHO PHIACHA AIE EIA LAE EIA THOTHO PHIACHA. 

Be kind to me, forefather, scion of 
The world, self-gendered, fire-bringer, aglow 
Like gold, shining on mortals, master of 
The world, / daimon of restless fire, unfailing, 

With gold disk, sending earth pure light in beams. 



71. The following dactylic hexameters are part of the reconstructed Hymn 4 (Preiscndanz, vol. II, 
pp. 239-40): v. 1-17, 20, 22-28. For other versions and sections of Hymn 4, see PGM I. 315-27; IV. 
1957-89; VIII. 74-80. [E.N.O.] 

72. For Horus equated with Helios, cf. PGM IV. 989.

Send the daimon, whomever I have requested, to her, NN” (add the usual). 

In another version, the name is: “achai phothotho aie ela lae eio tho tho 
ph i ac ha.” / In another it is: “achai phothotho aie iea eai lae aei ela otho- 465 

THO PHIACHA.”

* Charm to restrain anger: “Will you dare to raise your mightv spear against 
Zeus ?” 73 

*Tr.: R. F. Hock. The same spell occurs at PGM IV. 831-32. 



PGM TV. 469-70 

*To get friends: 

/ “Let . . . seize, lest we become a joy to our enemies.” 74 470 

*Tr.: Hubert Martin, Jr. The same charm using a verse from Homer ( Iliad 10. 193) occurs 

in PGM IV. 833—34. Since there the single verse alone serves as a charm to get friends, and 
since the papyrus manuscript separates all verses with paragraph marks, it seems likely that 
the following four verses served as separate charms, though the original titles have been lost. 
Furthermore, since the three verses (Iliad 10.564, 10.521, and 10.572) that follow form a 
natural grouping in PGM IV. 2145ff. (cf. IV. 821-23), we have preserved that grouping in 
PGM IV. 471— 73, below, though it is not clear whether the copyist inserted these verses here 
by mistake or whether the reader was to understand from PGM IV. 2145ff. that the spell 
served as a “divine assistance from three Homeric verses.” 



PGM IV. 471— 73 

* 

“After saying this, he drove the solid-hoofed horses through the ditch .” 75 

“and men gasping out their lives amid the terrible slaughter .” 76 

“and they washed off in die sea the sweat that covered them .” 77 
*Tr.: Hubert Martin, Jr. This untitled charm contains three verses of Homer that also occur 
in PGM IV. 821—23 and IV. 2145ff. It is presumed that these verses served the same func- 
tions as those listed in 11. 2145ff. See the introductory note on the previous spell. The verses 
all come from the tenth book of the Iliad and presumably could be read together. 

PGM TV. 474 

*“. . . Ares endured, when Otos and mighty Ephialtcs . . . him .” 78

73. Homer, II. 8. 424. For the use of single Homeric verses as charms and amulets, see R. Heim, 
“Incantamenta magica graeca latina,” Jahrbiicher filr classische Philologie , Supplemmtband 9 (1893), sec- 
tion X: Venus Homerici et Vergilicmi (pp. 514-20). 

74. Homer, II. 10. 193. 

75. Homer, II. 10. 564. The referent of “he” is Odysseus in the original context. 

76. Homer, II. 10. 521. Again, the papyrus quotes only a portion of the Homeric text. “Men” is the 
object of “saw” in 1. 520, and it is a kinsman of the slaughtered Rhesus who saw. 

77. Homer, II. 10. 572. In Homer, die referent of “they” is Odysseus and Diomedcs. 

78. Homer, II. 5. 385. The papyrus quotes only a single verse and leaves the syntax of “him” unac- 
counted for. In Homer, “him” is governed by “bound” in I. 386.

PGM IV. 475—829 

475 * Be gracious to me, O Providence and Psyche, 79 as I write these mysteries handed 

down [not] for gain but for instruction; and for an only child I request immor- 
tality, O initiates of this our power (furthermore, it is necessary for you, O daugh- 
480 ter, to take / the juices of herbs and spices, which will [be made known] to you at 
the end of my holy treatise), which the great god Helios Mithras ordered to be 
revealed to me by his archangel, so that I alone mav ascend into heaven as an in- 
485 quirer / and behold the universe. 

This is the invocation of the spell : 

“First origin of my origin, aeeioyO, first beginning of my beginning, ppp sss 80 
490 phr[e], spirit of spirit, 81 the first of the spirit / in me, mmm, fire given by god to

steadfast air, eioae psenabOth; that I may be bom again in thought, kraochrax

may gaze upon the unfathomable, awesome water of the dawn, nyo theso echo 
515 ouchiechoa, and the vivifying / and encircling aether may hear me, arno- 
methph; for today I am about to behold, with immortal eyes — I, born mortal 
from mortal womb, but transformed by tremendous power and an incorruptible 
520 right hand / and with immortal spirit, the immortal Aion and master of the fiery 
diadems — I, sanctified through holy consecrations — while there subsists within 
525 me, holy, for a short time, my human soul-might, which I will again / receive after 
the present bitter and relentless necessity which is pressing down upon me — I, NN, 
whose modier is NN, according to the immutable decree of god, eye yla eei ao

brightnesses of the immortal brilliance, oey aeo eya eoe yae oiae, stand, O per-

535 able and pressing / need. For I am the son psychon demou procho proa, I am 
macharph[.]n mou propsychon proe.” 

Draw in breath from the rays, drawing up 3 times as much as you can, and you 
540 will see yourself being lifted up and / ascending to the height, so that you seem to 
be in midair. You will hear nothing either of man or of any other living thing, nor in 
that hour will you see anything of mortal affairs on earth, but rather you will see all

immortal things. For in that day / and hour you will see the divine order of the 545 
skies: the presiding gods rising into heaven, and others setting. Now the course of 
the visible gods will appear through the disk of god, my father; and in similar fash- 
ion the so-called pipe, / the origin of the ministering wind. For you will see it hang- 550 
ing from the sun’s disk like a pipe. You will see the outflow of this object toward the 
regions westward, boundless as an east wind, if it be assigned to the regions of the 
east — and the other (viz., the west wind), similarly, toward its own / regions. And 555 
you will see the gods staring intently at you and rushing at you. 

So at once put your right finger on your mouth 88 and say: 

“Silence! Silence! Silence! 

Symbol of the living, incorruptible god! / 

Guard me, Silence, nechtheir thanmelou!” 560 

Then make a long hissing sound, next make a popping sound, and say: 
“PROPROPHEGGE MORIOS PROPHYR PROPHEGGE NEMETHIRE ARPSENTEN PI- 
TETMI MEOY ENARTH PHYRKECHO PSYRIDARIO / TYRE PHILBA.” 565 

Then you will see the gods looking graciously upon you and no longer rushing at 
you, but rather going about in their own order of affairs. 

So when you sec that the world above is clear / and circling, and that none of the 570 
gods or angels is threatening you, expect to hear a great crash of thunder, so as to 
shock you. Then say again: 

“Silence! Silence! (the prayer) I am a star, wandering about with you, and shin- 
ing forth out of / the deep, oxy o xbrtheuth.” 575 

Immediately after you have said these things the sun’s disk will be expanded. And 
after you have said the second prayer, where there is “Silence! Silence!” and the 
accompanying words, make a hissing sound twice and a popping sound twice, and 
immediately you will see / many five-pronged stars coming forth from the disk and 580 
filling all tile air. Then say again: “Silence! Silence!” And when the disk is open, you 
will see the fireless circle, and the fiery doors shut tight. / 

At once close your eyes and recite the following prayer. The third prayer : 585 

“Give ear to me, hearken to me, NN, whose mother is NN, O lord, you who 
have bound together with your breath the fiery bars of the fourfold / root, 84 590

Say all these things with fire and spirit, until completing the first utterance; then, 
620 similarly, begin the second, until you complete the / 7 immortal gods of the world. 86 
When you have said these things, you will hear thundering and shaking in die sur- 
rounding realm; and you will likewise feel yourself being agitated. Then say again: 
625 “Silence!” (the prayer). Then open your eyes, and you will see the doors / open and 

the world of the gods which is within the doors, so that from the pleasure and joy 
of the sight your spirit runs ahead and ascends. 

So stand still and at once draw breath from the divine into yourself, while you 
630 look intently. Then when / your soul is restored, say: 

“Come, lord, archandara phOtaza pyriphota zabythlx etimenmero 

PHORATHEN ERIE PROTHRI PHORATHI.” 

When you have said this, the rays will turn toward you; look at the center of 
635 them. For when / you have done this, you will see a youthful god, beautiful in ap- 
pearance, with fiery hair, and in a white tunic and a scarlet cloak, and wearing a 
fiery crown. 87 At once greet him with the fire greeting:

has been born again from you today, has become immortal out of so many myriads 
in this hour according to the wish of god the exceedingly good — resolves to wor- 
ship / you, and prays with all his human power, that you may take along with you 650 
the horoscope of the day and hour today, which has the name thrapsiari mor- 
irok, that he may appear and give revelation during the good hours, eoro rore 
ORRI ORIOR ROR ROI / OR REORORI EOR EOR BORE!” 655 

After you have said these things, he will come to the celestial pole, and vou will 
see him walking as if on a road. Look intently, and make a long bellowing sound, 
like a horn, releasing all your breath and straining your sides; and kiss / the phvlac- 660 
teries and say, first toward the right: “Protect me, prosymeri!” 

After saying this, you will see the doors 89 thrown open, and seven virgins 90 com- 
ing from deep within, dressed in linen garments, and with the faces of asps. 91 They 
arc called the Fates / of heaven, and wield golden wands. When you see them, greet 665 
them in this manner: 

“Hail, O seven Fates of heaven, O noble and good virgins, O sacred ones and com- 
panions of minimirrophor, O most holy guardians of the four pillars! 92 / Hail to 670 
you, the first, chrepsenthaes! Hail to you, the second, meneschees! Hail to

die fifth, echommiB/ Ha il to you, the sixth, tichnondaes! Hail to you, the sev- 
enth, erou rombries!” 

There also come forth another seven gods, 94 who have the faces of black bulls, in 
linen / loincloths, and in possession of seven golden diadems. They are the so- 675 
called Pole Lords of heaven, whom you must greet in the same manner, each of 
them with his own name: 

“Hail, O guardians of the pivot, O sacred and brave youths, who turn / at one 680 
command die revolving axis of the vault of heaven, who send out thunder and light- 
ning and jolts of earthquakes and diunderbolts against the nations of impious 
people, but to me, who am pious and god-fearing, you send health and soundness 
of body / and acuteness of hearing and seeing, and calmness in the present good 685 
hours of this day, O my lords and powerfully ruling gods! Hail to you, the first, 
aieronthi! Hail to you, the second, mercheimeros! Hail to you, the third,

and a god descending, a god immensely great, having a bright appearance, youth- 
ful, golden-haired, with a white tunic and a golden crown and trousers , 95 and hold- 
700 ing in his right hand a golden / shoulder of a young bull: this is the Bear which 
moves and turns heaven around, moving upward and downward in accordance with 
the hour . 96 Then you will see lightning bolts leaping from his eyes and stars from 
his body. 

705 And at once / make a long bellowing sound, straining your belly, that you may 
excite the five senses; bellow long until out of breath, and again kiss the phylac- 
teries, and say: 

710 “mokrimo PHERIMO phereri, life of me, NN: stay! Dwell in / my soul ! 97 Do 
not abandon me, for entho phenen thropioth commands you.” 

And gaze upon the god while bellowing long; and greet him in this manner: 

“Hail, O Lord, O Master of the water! Hail, O Founder of the earth! Hail, O 
715 Ruler of the wind! O Bright Lightener /, proprophegge emethiri artentepi 
theth mimeo yenaro phyrchecho pseri dario phre phrelba! Give revela- 
tion, O lord, concerning the NN matter. O lord, while being born again, I am pass- 
720 ing away; while growing and having grown, / I am dying; while being bom from a 
life-generating birth, I am passing on, released to death— as you have founded, as 
you have decreed, and have established the mystery. I am pheroura miouri.” 

After you have said these things, he will immediately respond with a revelation. / 
725 Now you will grow weak in soul and will not be in yourself, when he answers you. 
He speaks the oracle to you in verse, and after speaking he will depart. But you 
remain silent, since you will be able to comprehend all these matters by yourself; for 
730 at a later time / you will remember infallibly the things spoken by the great god, 
even if the oracle contained myriads of verses. 

If you also wish to use a fellow initiate, so that he alone may hear with you the 
735 things spoken, let him remain pure with you for [seven] / days, and abstain from 
meat and the bath. And even if you are alone, and you undertake the things com- 
municated by the god, you speak as if prophesying in ecstasy. And if you also wish 
740 to show him, then judge whether he is completely worthy as a man /: treat him just 
as if in his place you were being judged in the matter of immortalization, and whis- 
per to him the first prayer, of which the beginning is “First origin of my origin , 98 
745 aeeioyo.” And say the successive things as an initiate, over his / head, in a soft 
voice , 99 so that he may not hear, as you are anointing his face with the mystery. This 
immortalization takes place three times a year. And if anyone, O child, after the 
750 teaching, wishes to disobey, then for him it will no longer / be in effect. 

95. The description of the god Mithras agrees with extant pictures. See esp. the frescoes from Dura 
Europos, published in M. J. Vermaseren, Corpus inscriptionum et monumentarum religionis Mithriacae 
(Den Haag: Nijhoff, 1956, 1960); see also die discussion in Dieterich, Mithrasliturgie 76- 78. 

96. For the interpretation of this passage, see Dieterich, Mithrasliturgie 76-78, 234; R. Beck, “In- 
terpreting die Ponza Zodiac,” journal ofM ithraic Studies 1 (1976) : 1—19, esp. 2; 2 (1978) : 87— 147, esp. 
120—27; R. L. Gordon and J. R. Hinnels, “Some New Photographs of Well-known Mithraic Monu- 
ments,” ibid. 2 (1978): 213- 19. Cf. also Griffith and Thompson, The Leyden Papyrus , col. V. 1 with 
note; te Velde, Seth, God of Confusion 86— 89. 

97. The combination of £anj “life,” and t fwxr} “soul,” suggests erotic overtones (see Juvenal, Sat. 6. 
195 for liorj Kai tfwxy, and the note on PGM IV. 377). [E.N.O.] In fact, sculptures portraying Eros and 
Psyche were found in the Mithras sanctuaries at Capua and under the Church of S. Prisca in Rome. Sec 
Merkelbach, Weihegmde 22—24, and photos on pp. 68—69.

Instruction for the rite : Take a sun scarab which has twelve rays, and make it fall 
into a deep, turquoise cup, at the time when the moon is invisible; 100 put in to- 
gether with it the seed of the fruit pulp of the lotus, / and honey; and, after grind- 755 

ing it, prepare a cake. And at once you will see it [viz., the scarab] moving forward 
and eating; and when it has consumed it, it immediately dies. Pick it up and throw 
it into a glass vessel of excellent rose oil, as much as you wish; and / spreading sa- 760 
cred sand in a pure manner, set the vessel on it, and say the formula over the vessel 
for seven days, while the sun is in midheaven: 

“I have consecrated you, that your material may be useful to me, to NN alone, ie 
ia See o y eia, that you may prove useful to me / alone, for 1 am phor phora 765 
pros photizaas” (others: “phor phor ophothei xaas”). 

On the 7th day pick up the scarab, and bury it with myrrh and Mendesian 
wine 101 and fine linen; and put it away in a flourishing bean field. / Then, after you 770 
have entertained and feasted together, put away, in a pure manner, the ointment for 
the immortalization. 

If you want to show this to someone else, take the juice of the herb called ken- 
tritis, and smear, it, along with rose oil, over the eyes of the one you wish; / and he 775 
will see so clearly that he will amaze you. I have not found a greater spell than this in 
the world. Ask the god for what you want, and he will give to you. 

Now the encounter with the great god is like this: Having obtained the above- 
mentioned herb / kentritis , at the conjunction [of the sun and the moon] occurring 780 
in the Lion, 102 take the juice and, after mixing it with honey and myrrh, write on a 
leaf of the persea tree the eight-lettered name, as given below. 103 And having kept 
yourself pure for 3 days in advance, come at morning to face the sunrise; / lick off 785 
the leaf while you show it to the sun, and then he [the sun god] will listen to you 
attentively. Begin to prepare [the scarab] on the new moon in the lion, according to 
the god’s [reckoning]. 104 

Now this is the name : “i ee oo iai.” Lick this up, so that you may be protected; 
and rolling up the leaf /, throw it into the rose oil. Many times have I used the spell, 790 
and have wondered greatly. 

But the god said to me: 

“Use the ointment no longer, but, after casting it into the river, [you must] con- 
sult while wearing die great mystery / of the scarab revitalized through the 25 liv- 795 
ing birds, 103 and consult once a month, at full moon, instead of 3 times a year.” 

The kentritis plant grows from die month of Payni, in the regions of the / black 800 

earth, and is similar to the erect verbena. This is how' to recognize it: an ibis wing is 
dipped at its black tip and smeared with the juice, and the feathers fall off when 
touched. After die lord / pointed this out, it was found in Menelaitis in Phalagry, at 805 
the river banks, near the besas plant. It is of a single stem, and reddish down to the 
root; and the leaves are rather crinkled and have fruit / like the tip of wild as- 810 
paragus. It is similar to the so-called tedapes , like the wild beet. 



100. Literally, “at the seizure of the moon,” probably designating the new moon. 

101. Cf. PGM I. 85-86 and n. 

102. That is, at the new moon. 

103. See PGM IV. 788. 

104. The new moon of god, according to the heavens, in contrast to the new moon of man, accord- 
ing to die calendar. 

105. The allusion to the twenty-five birds is obscure; it may be related to the hours, so that the scarab 
Khepri is reborn in the first hour of a new day, after the passage of twelve hours of day and twelve hours 
of night during the previous day.

Now the phylacteries require this procedure: copy that for the right [arm] onto 
815 the skin / of a black sheep, with myrrh ink, and after tying it with sinews of 
the same animal, put it on; and copy that [for] the left [arm] onto the skin of a 
white sheep, and use the same procedure. The left one is very full of “prosthy- 
820 meri” /, and has this memorandum: 106 

“So speaking, he drove through the trench the single-hoofed horses.” 107 
“And men gasping among grievous slaughters.” 108 
“And the}' washed off their profuse sweat in the sea.” 109 
“You will dare to lift up your mighty spear against Zeus.” 110

106. The relationship of the poetic quotations in the following, which repeat those in 11. 468- 74, 
and the Mithras liturgy is obscure. They seem unrelated; see Wcsseiy, Griechiscbe Zauberpapyrns (see 
above. Introduction, n. 24), which shows a blank after 1. 820 and a sign indicating a new paragraph. For 
a different view, cf. Dieterich, Mitbraslitnrgie 84. [M.S.] 

107. Homer, II. 10. 564. 

108. Homer, II. 10. 521. 

109. Homer, II. 10. 572. 

110. Homer, II. 8. 424. See PGM TV. 46/— 68 above and 830—31 below. Probably this verse served 
as a spell to restrain anger, but it may be misplaced here. 

111. That these verses are part of the vTro/jurqfjLa (“the memorandum,” 1. 821) seems unlikely. More 
probably, a heading has been lost, and die verses contain an altogether independent spell. Story spells 
( bistoriolae ) were ancient (see Faulkner, Coffin Texts , nos. 7, 75, 148, 154, 157, 158, etc.). They usually 
tell of a happening such as they are meant to produce (cf., e.g., PGM VII. 199-201; IV. 1471-79). This 
story tells of a person compelled or bribed to give up something; it could have been used to make a 
person give up anger. Hence it may have been attached to the Homeric verse for that purpose and was 
interpolated here. The name Amara is obscure; it could mean “the bitter woman” (Hebrew or Latin- cf 
Ru 1:20, Vulgate). 

112. Cf Pistis Sophia 136 and 142, also widi permutations of iao. psinother is Egyptian for “die 
sons of god.” [ R.K.R.] See also PGM III. 186 and n. See Glossary', s.v. “thernopsi formula.” 

113. Homer, II. 5. 385. The same verse occurs in PGM IV. 474. 

114. Homer, II. 6. 424, quoted also PGM IV. 468, 824. 

115. Homer, II. 10. 193. See PGM IV. 470, where the same verse is quoted.

then to Helios 19 months, which would be 57 years 8 months. In this period as- 
signed to Helios, that is to the 19 months, devote yourself to what you seek. After 
this he assigned to Ares 15 months, which would be 58 years 11 months. This is a 
hostile period. / Then to Selene 25 months, which would be 61 years. They are 845

123. The translation of this difficult term follows Preisendanz (see apparatus ad loc.). 

124. amoun eei is equivalent to Egyptian “Amon comes” (?), with Greek ijet standing for Egyptian 

iy . [R.K.R.] 

125. Probably referring to barking; cf. PGM IV. 1006. 

126. This is equivalent to die type of Demotic spell called ph-ntr-s pell, literally, a “god’s arrival” spell. 
See J. H. Johnson, “Louvre E 3229: A Demotic Magical Text,” Enchoria 7 (1977) : 90-91. 

127. According to Domseiff, Das Alphabet 184, the mystical number is 3663 and refers to bain- 
choooch (the numerical value of the Greek letters being 2 + 1 + 10 + 50 + 600 + 800 + 800 + 600 
= 3663. 

128. Preisendanz ends the hymn at 1. 948, but the petition to the god continues through 1. 955. LI. 
949—54 include references to the spell for a direct vision, the lamp divination, and the prayer for divine 
alliance. Thus the present form of these lines conies from the time when the spell was put together. LI. 
949-54 contain vestiges of verse and originally may have been part of the hymn which was composed 
by the final audtor; or they may be a prose addition to part of an earlier hymn, perhaps substituting for, 
or expanding the petition in, the original hymn. [W.C.G.] 

129. These dactylic hexameters also form the reconstructed Hvmn 3; see Preisendanz, vol. II, 
p. 238. 

130. re, though necessary to the sense, mars die hexameter. [E.N.O.] 

131 . A possible echo of a pre-Socratic expression, but to the author of this spell this phrase must have 
had a much different meaning. Preisendanz wants to emend and read <f>ucri Kai tmpo? apxq (“O Nature 
and fire’s origin”), but the emendation is more clever than persuasive. For Physis as a goddess, sec PGM 
I. 310 and n. [E.N.O.]
